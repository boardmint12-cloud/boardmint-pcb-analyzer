Abstract
Industry practice and “rules of thumb” will vary when considering the
proper voltage rating of a capacitor. There is a significant difference
in derating rules between competing capacitor technologies. This
FAQ addresses some common questions related to voltage strength
of TDK MLCCs. Based on reliability and performance needs, the
design engineers must decide component selections based on the
acceptable reliability factors. This FAQ will answer some questions
to assist in determining voltage rating selection.

Q1. What is voltage strength?
A1. Voltage strength refers to how much voltage a
part can withstand. This discussion will focus on
TDK capacitors. There are different voltage
strength thresholds depending on the application
or stress conditions.

Typically voltage strength represents the maximum
level of continuous voltage that can be applied
across a capacitor. Voltage strength is just one
factor used to determine the manufacturer’s
voltage rating. Different capacitor technologies
may require derating of the rated voltage in actual
use conditions.
                                                                             Table 1: Vbd comparison

voltage, they do not require any voltage derating.


Q3. How can voltage strength be measured?
A3. Voltage strength can be measured using a test
called voltage breakdown (Vbd). This is a
destructive test where DC voltage is applied at a
controlled ramp rate until the part fails. The ramp
rate can be any rate but 50 volts per second is
often used. When comparing Vbd results, it is
important to ensure all parts were tested under the
same conditions. Once the maximum voltage is
applied, the dielectric will begin to breakdown and
cause the part to fail. Typical Vbd for MLCCs are
much greater than the rated voltage while Vbd for
electrolytics are much lower. (Table 1)

1.0       GENERAL LAYOUT CONSIDERATIONS
This section describes layout considerations for the CEC1702 device. This includes the following topics:
• Section 1.1, "Decoupling Capacitors," on page 2
• Section 1.2, "32.768kHz Crystal Oscillator," on page 4
• Section 1.3, "CAP Pins, AVSS/GND Connection," on page 5
• Section 1.4, "PCB Mounted Analog Power Supply Filter for PLL Usage," on page 5
• Section 1.5, "BGA Package PCB Layout Considerations," on page 6

1.1       Decoupling Capacitors
This section includes the following topics:
• Section 1.1.1, "CEC1702 WFBGA Capacitors," on page 2
Decoupling capacitors should be placed as close to the chip as possible to keep series inductance low. When the capac-
itors are mounted on the bottom side of the PCB, the capacitors are connected to the ground plane from the bottom
layer directly using the shortest path to the device. Each VCC pin should have a 0.1 F capacitor located as close to
the pin as possible. Bypass capacitors should be placed close to the supply pins of the CEC1702 with short and wide
traces.
The CEC1702 has an integrated voltage regulator to supply the core circuitry. Decoupling this regulator requires a crit-
ical capacitor of 1F on the CAP pin. ESR of this 1F capacitor, including the routing resistance, must be less than 100
mOhm.
Capacitors may carry large currents that generate magnetic fields, inducing noise on nearby traces. Sensitive traces
such as the 32kHz crystal should be separated by at least five times the trace width from decoupling capacitors when
possible.
Connecting decoupling caps to power and ground planes using two vias per pad will reduce series inductance.

1.2      32.768kHz Crystal Oscillator
This section describes specific layout and design considerations for the 32.768kHz crystal oscillator; this can be used
to source the internal 32kHz clock domain, in lieu of the silicon oscillator or an external pin. The crystal implementation
is required to support the RTC function within the CEC1702.

1.2.1        32.768KHZ CRYSTAL OSCILLATOR LAYOUT
The CEC1702 32kHz crystal oscillator is designed to generate an synchronous on-chip clock signal with an appropriate
external oscillator crystal. The design has been optimized for low power (1.5 μW typical), stability and minimum jitter
using a general purpose parallel resonant 32kHz crystal. For a suggested part number, please see the CEC1702 EVB
schematic (see References).
This unique low power crystal oscillator drive circuit means that a standard inverter crystal layout should not be used.
The design has been characterized to allow a variation of 4pF to 18pF on each pin. Based on the following load capac-
itance calculation, Microchip recommends 10pf load capacitors with a crystal that has a 9pf Cl rating. Other than these
capacitors, no additional external components are required for normal operation of the clock circuit.




Where:
• C12 is the cap from pin XTAL1 to ground.
• C13 is the cap from pin XTAL2 to ground.
• Cpin_xtal2 is the pin capacitance of pin XTAL2. This is estimated to be 5pf (Note 1-1).
• Cpin_xtal1 is the pin capacitance of pin XTAL1. This is estimated to be 3pf (Note 1-1).
• Cbrd is estimated at 1.5pF.
  Note 1-1      At the time of publication, the CEC1702 silicon has not been characterized. Please check with your
                Microchip FAE for final pin capacitance values after silicon validation is complete. Any variation from
                the estimates provided here could change the crystal Cl value requirement.

1.2.2        CRYSTAL ACCURACY
The accuracy of the 32kHz input translates directly into accuracy of the internal clock and the functions in the CEC1702
using the 32kHz: 32KHZ_OUT, week timer, hibernation timers, and so forth.
The accuracy, with regard to actual error in time can be illustrated as such: +/-1ppm of error in frequency corresponds
to 32.768 kHz x 1ppm x 10-6 = +/-0.032768 Hz. This translates into ~1 µsec/sec or ~+/-0.086 sec/day.
Based on customer RTC accuracy timer requirements, Microchip recommends using a +/-20ppm crystal. This would
equal approximately +/-2 sec/day, other factors discounted.
For arguments sake, it is safe to say that stray capacitance is difficult to calculate exactly. So, as an exercise in com-
pleteness, this calculation describes the effect of each picofarad of additional capacitance over/under the crystal Cload
value:




where C0 is the shunt capacitance, C1 is the motional capacitance and CL is the load capacitance of the chosen crystal
(these numbers can be found in the crystal data sheet). For example, using a crystal with C0 = 0.8pF, C1 = 0.0019pF,
CL = 12.5pF, we get a shift of 5.37ppm/pF. So, in terms of time, each pF of added/subtracted capacitance is approxi-
mately 5.37 x 0.086 = +/-462 msec/day for this particular crystal.
This example is meant to illustrate the magnitude of the potential error. In practice, slight capacitance mismatch does
not equate to many seconds a day.

1.2.3       SINGLE ENDED CLOCKING
An external clock source (maximum voltage of 3.3V) may be applied to the XTAL2 pin if the XOSEL bit in Clock Enable
Register configures as a single-ended 32.768 kHz clock input (SUSCLK). The XTAL1 pin should be left floating. If an
external clock source is used, the designer must ensure that the source is available in all desired power states in which
the EC will be active.

1.3      CAP Pins, AVSS/GND Connection
The recommended filtering for the CAP pin on the CEC1702 is shown in Figure 1-2, for WFBGA connections. The fil-
tering components shown should be placed close to the device and away from noise sources.

1.4      PCB Mounted Analog Power Supply Filter for PLL Usage
To achieve a reasonable level of long term jitter, it is vital to deliver an analog-grade power supply to the PLL.Typically
an R-C or R-L-C filter is usually used, with the "C" being composed of multiple devices to achieve a wide spectrum of
noise absorption. Although the circuit is simple, there are specific board layout requirements if it is to work at all.
The series resistance of this filter is limited for DC reasons; generally we like to see <<5% voltage drop across this
device under worst-case conditions. High quality series inductors should not be used without a series resistor lest a high
gain series resonator is created.
To achieve good low-frequency cut off there should be an electrolytic capacitor in the filter design. As the filter also needs
to sustain its attenuation into moderately high frequencies, so there will additionally be at least one non-electrolytic
capacitor in parallel. The leads of the high frequency capacitor(s) must be kept short. In some applications the electro-
lytic capacitor is not required, but it is better to have a space for in on the board which you later leave vacant, rather than
have a jittering PLL and no-where to put the cap. Cursory analysis suggests that a third, very high frequency, capacitor
should help reduce noise – but experimental data has not shown any jitter benefit in real applications.
Board layout around the high-frequency capacitor and the path from there to the pads is critical. It is vital that the quiet
ground and power are treated like analog signals.
The power (VDD) path must be a single wire from the IC package pin to the high frequency cap, then to the low fre-
quency cap, and then through the series element (e.g. resistor) then to board power (VDD). The distance from the IC
pin to the high frequency cap should be as short as possible.
Similarly, the ground (VSS) path should be from the IC pin to the high frequency cap, to the low frequency cap, with the
distance from IC pin to high frequency cap being very short. Modern PLLs will have the DC ground connection made
on chip, so the external ground connection must not be connected to PCB ground. With some older designs, where the
DC ground connection is not on-chip, a trace would be run from the low frequency cap to board ground, near the VDD
connection – be aware of this difference if converting an old board design.




 2017-2019 Microchip Technology Inc.                                                                    DS00002402C-page 5
AN2402
In all applications, the power and ground traces should be short, and run close and parallel as far as is possible, with
large spacing to adjacent traces. On no account should any connection be made from VDD or VSS_PLL to board power
planes; only connect as described above.

1.4.1       REAL WORLD COMPONENT SELECTION
Throughout the attenuating frequency range, there should be no resonant non-absorptions. This means that the series
element will either be a resistor or a very poor (i.e. resistive) inductor.
Having got the series element with the most impedance as we can, the filter requires the highest value high frequency
capacitor we can find in a small package (often 100nF). In applications with a low PLL reference frequency and envi-
ronment with significant low frequency components, it is often beneficial to add a large value capacitor such as an elec-
trolytic which fits nicely on the board (often 22uF).
The Figure 1-3 as shown below is reference schematic represents both the circuity and the device placement. The com-
ponent values are only illustrative.

1.5       BGA Package PCB Layout Considerations
The CEC1702 devices have BGA lead-free RoHS-Compliant package as follows:
• 84-pin WFBGA: 7mm x 7mm, 0.65mm ball pitch

  Note:     Please refer to the latest data sheet for most up-to-date PCB LAND pattern information.


The following list summarizes BGA routing guidelines, but it is understood that final layout is process- dependent and
your design should reflect your needs:
• Through-hole vias technology is not recommended for pitches less than 0.8mm (unless the ball matrix is depopu-
  lated in the center)
• NSMD ball pads for pitches 0.8mm – 0.4mm
• Solder Mask to be 1:1 scale of the land size, when routing 0.5mm pitch ball pads
• Vias – next generation PCB technology for tighter pitches
• Eliminate through-hole vias
• Increase routing density & enhance electrical performance
• Decrease routing layers
• Provide fan-out solutions for multiple layers (stacked Vias)

2.2      Battery Circuit
Please see the Power Sources section of the CEC1702 Data Sheet.
For the battery circuity requirement, VBAT must always be present if VTR is present. The following circuit is recom-
mended to fulfill this requirement.

2.3      EOS Considerations
For SMBus signals that terminate external to the main system board (for example, Smart Battery) the designer should
take care in protecting these signals from EOS (Note 2-1) and ESD (Note 2-2). Please refer to the SMBus 2.0 specifi-
cation, section 3.1.2.2 for appropriate guidelines. The specification recommends a series protection resistor and an
optional ESD transorb on these nets. In addition to the SMBus specification recommendation, past experience shows
that using 2 high speed diodes on each SMBus trace (instead of the transorb in the SMBus spec) is an effective way to
improve immunity to EOS and ESD events. A Schottky diode pair is a good example. Figure 2-2 shows the suggested
circuit implementation for each net that goes to a connector.




DS00002402C-page 10                                                               2017-2019 Microchip Technology Inc.
                                                                                                     AN2402

FIGURE 2-2:            SCHOTTKY DIODE PAIR EXAMPLE




It should also be noted that any other signal that goes to an external connector should also be considered for EOS/ESD
susceptibility. For instance, an ID pin (tied to a GPIO) that might seem benign, but is routed near high voltage sources
could suffer transient EOS events. A similar protection scheme should be considered for these nets.
  Note 2-1      EOS is defined as damage to the part caused by the application of voltages (to any pin) beyond the
                power supply rails, usually forward biasing internal protection diodes and resulting in high levels of
                current flow. This typically induces open failures by damaging the metal inside the part. EOS is
                typically a low voltage, high current situation.
  Note 2-2      ESD is the applied reverse bias to the PN junction -- heat due to power dissipation melts the silicon
                in the part. ESD is typically a high transient voltage spike with low current situation.

2.4      ADC Input Layout Requirements for Regular Sampling
ADC has a large internal resistance.
Every ADC input terminal has a gate switch.
This gate switch is protected by diodes.
It is natural for diodes have leakage current.


At sampling time: (Gate switch closed)
Input voltage is charged and sampled at sample point A.
Sampling time is affected by RC time constant defined by internal resistor and internal capacitor.


In continuous mode, the sampling time is too fast for sample point A to discharge sampled value. In this case, glitch will
not be observed.


In one shot mode or in long report mode, the sampling time is long enough for point A to discharge sampled value.
In this case, glitch will be observed on the next sampling point.


If an external capacitor with value between 0.1uF and 0.01uF (point C2) is placed on the input terminal, the charged
value at point A will be kept as it is instead of discharging it and then glitch will not be observed.

For high sampling frequencies, it is recommend to set the cut off frequency of the R/C at ½ of the ADC sampling fre-
quency / 10.

2.5       SPI Flash Implementation
The CEC1702 SPI flash interface enables the embedded controller (EC) access to an external SPI flash device. The
CEC1702 Data Sheet and Boot ROM Application Note have more details on detail information (see References on page
1). This section describes specific PCB layout design considerations to setup this feature.

  Note:    The SPI Flash Interface of CEC1702 can be selected either 3.3V or 1.8V. The QSPI0 interface is on VTR2
           power rail.

The standard set of SPI flash signals are designated with “SHD_” for shared connections, for example, SHD_CLK; for
details, see section 2.5.2. The CEC1702 has an added set of signals for connection to another SPI flash device as pri-
vate, protected data; these signals are designated with “PVT_,” for example, PVT_CLK; for details, see Section 2.5.3
“NON-SHARED SPI FLASH INTERFACE”. The CEC1702 has a third SPI interface as a general SPI interface labeled
as “SPI_,” for example, SPI_CLK.

          2: Resistor recommendations are based on testing with 180nm PCH and SPI flash drivers. Any change to a
             driver would require a change to the related termination resistors, see also Note 1.
          3: L1, L2, L3 must be equal to each other. For example, if L1 = 2-inches, then L3 must be 2-inches.

AN2402
2.5.4       SPI FLASH IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS
• The following recommendations are for both Shared and Non-Shared SPI Flash Implementations.
• The CEC1702 SPI memory interface has serial flash device compatibility requirements that are defined in the
  CEC1702 Data Sheet. Please make sure the selected SPI flash meets these requirements.
• SPI_CLK must be 20mils spacing from any other high frequency (>1GHz) signal.
• The SPI flash parts should support operating at 12MHz for the ROM code loader, and up to 48MHz clock speed in
  RAM code loading. • The designer should follow the SPI interface host design guidelines.
• IBIS models are available to aid in simulating the SPI system topology.
• The chip select CS# signals should have weak pullup resistors to the same power rail as the SPI flash. The pullup
  resistor value should meet the rise time requirements of the SPI flash.
• EC firmware must configure the CEC1702 SPI memory interface to disable mode, which will tri-state the SPI
  memory interface from CEC1702 to the SPI flash, before releasing the RSMRST# signal.
• This configuration requires that the PCH tri-state its SPI flash pins when RSMRST# is asserted.
• The characteristic impedance of the PCB trace should be 50 ohms +/-15% at 50MHz operating frequency.
• Within the SPI flash device, Schmitt trigger inputs are assumed on both the clock line and IO data lines.
• Within the Intel PCH, a Schmitt trigger input is assumed on the IO data lines.
• The output drivers for the SPI flash chip select pins should be programmed as open-drain using the GPIO Pin
  Control registers.
• The SPI Data IO traces should be length-matched to the CLK lines within 0.100-inch.
• Signal Integrity should be checked for each SPI part on your BOM.

2.5.5       SPI FLASH EXTERNAL PROGRAMMER
The SPI Flash on either Shared or Non-Shared SPI Flash interface must be programmed externally using a suitable
programmer, such as Dediprog’s SF100 (http://www.dediprog.com/pd/spi-flash-solution/sf100). Provisions for a pro-
gramming header on each SPI flash are recommended if the SPI is not socketed. 2.9 1MHz.

2.6       1MHz Pullup Resistor Requirement
Please refer to the I2C-bus specification and user manual as indicated in the section References on page 1 for more
information.

2.7       5V Tolerant Pins
There are ten 3.3V/5V tolerant (over-voltage) pins on the CEC1702. Please see the CEC1702 Data Sheet section 2.5.7
for more information.

  Note:     Pins with over-voltage protection may be pulled up externally to 5V supply. It is recommended to select
            strong pull-up resistor value (less than 10k ohms) that keep the pull-up voltage on the pin less than 3.8V
            and above 4.5V. If the voltage is between 3.8V and 4.5V, the pad current will be higher (~65uA nominal).



2.8       1.8V Capability
There are two voltage supply regions for all GPIO pins powered by VTR1 and VTR2. Each region may be either 3.3V
or 1.8V. Please refer to the CEC1702 Data Sheet section 2 for more information.

2.9      Power Switch Input
For the VBAT-powered power switch inputs (VCI_INx#) there is a specific requirement for the input circuit as illustrated
in Figure 2-6. The resistors can use any typical 1/10W, +/- 1% carbon, thick, metal, or thin film. The capacitors can use
any typical 16V 10% ceramic. Unused VCI pins should be pulled up to VBAT via a 100K resistor. Please refer to the
CEC1702 EVB Schematics and Bill of Materials.


FIGURE 2-6:            VBAT-POWERED CONTROL INPUT CIRCUIT




2.10     VCI_IN Pins when Used as GPIO
All the VCI_IN pins can be used as GPIOs. In addition to programming the alternate function field in the GPIO Control
register for the GPIO function the firmware must also disable the VCI input. To disable the VCI input the firmware must
clear (i.e., set to '0') both the VCI_BUFFER_EN bit in the VCI BUFFER ENABLE REGISTER and the IE bit in the VCI
INPUT ENABLE REGISTER.

3.0      JTAG DESIGN AND LAYOUT GUIDE
This section provides general hardware information for using the CEC1702 JTAG interface and working with JTAG mas-
ter and slaves.
This document includes the following topics:
• Section 3.1, "CEC1702 JTAG Capabilities," on page 18
• Section 3.2, "General PCB Layout Considerations for JTAG," on page 18
• Section 3.3, "Pin Connections," on page 18
• Section 3.4, "JTAG Internal Pull-Up," on page 20
• Section 3.5, "JTAG Reset," on page 20

3.1      CEC1702 JTAG Capabilities
CEC1702 devices have the following debug capabilities:
• JTAG-Based DAP Port, Comprised of SWJ-DP and AHB-AP Debugger Access Functions
• Full DWT Hardware Functionality: 4 Data Watchpoints and Execution Monitoring
• Full FPB Hardware Breakpoint Functionality: 6 Execution Breakpoints and 2 Literal (Data) Breakpoints
• Accessed via 4-wire JTAG or 2-wire ARM SWD (Default)
• Comprehensive ARM-Standard Trace Support: Full DWT, ITM, ETM, TPIU functionalities

3.2      General PCB Layout Considerations for JTAG
Please follow the PCI Specification’s Routing and Layout Guidelines for the JTAG interface signals to support the JTAG
interface speed up to 33MHz.
• In order to improve the clock transmission line’s signal integrity, the following is recommended:
  - Keep the clock traces as straight as possible
  - Use arc-shaped traces instead of right-angle bends
  - Do not use multiple signal layers
  - Do not use vias to reduce impedance change and reflection
  - Place a ground plane next to the outer layer to minimize noise effect
  - Terminate clock signals to minimize reflection
• The JTAG cable that attaches to the CEC1702 motherboard has a standard 20-pin 0.1” spacing female connector
  on it. Normally, the CEC1702 motherboard just has a 20-pin 0.1” spacing pin strip on the board to mate with it.
• If the CEC1702 motherboard design does not have the space for a 20-pin male pin strip, then the board designer
  can place a 6 pin header on the motherboard and build a 6-pin to 20-pin adapter cable to attach to the 20-pin
  female connector on the JTAG cable. This is shown in Figure 3-1, "6-Pin to 20-Pin Adapter Board (w/ BOM)".

3.3      Pin Connections
3.3.1      4-WIRE JTAG CONNECTION
Six signals are the minimum number required on the motherboard side; these are described in Table 3-1 and illustrated
in FIGURE 3-1: 6-Pin to 20-Pin Adapter Board (w/ BOM) on page 19.

                   The motherboard VTR is always 3.3V. It is recommended to add a 49-ohm series
VTR                resistor for motherboard protection. The JTAG cable senses the voltage level on this
                   line and drives the JTAG logic levels to the same voltage level from the target system.

  Note 1: The 10K pullups that are shown in Figure 3-1 are used on CEC1702 JTAG inputs to prevent them from float-
          ing when the JTAG cable is not attached.
        2: The CEC1702 JTAG RST# pin connects to a 100K pullup to always enable the JTAG interface. Board design
           can provide pads for a pullup and pulldown for this pin in motherboard layout.
        3: In order to prevent potential damage, use a keyed connector to avoid plugging the cable in backward which
           would result in a short between VTR and ground.
        4: Add zero-ohm resistors to the JTAG link if there is a JTAG chain is used.

3.3.2       2-WIRE JTAG CONNECTION
Five signals are the minimum number required on the motherboard side; these are described in Table 3-2.

3.4       JTAG Internal Pull-Up
The firmware can select which debug pins to enable the internal pull-high. Default is disabled. Please see the CEC1702
Data Sheet DEBUG ENABLE REGISTER (4000_FC20h) for more information.

3.5       JTAG Reset
When the JTAG_RST# pin is not asserted (logic'1'), the JTAG_TDI, JTAG_TDO, JTAG_TCK, JTAG_TMS signal func-
tions in the JTAG interface are unconditionally routed to the JTAG interface; the Pin Control register for these pins has
no effect. When the JTAG_RST# pin is asserted (logic'0'), the JTAG_TDI, JTAG_TDO, JTAG_TCK, JTAG_TMS signal
functions in the JTAG interface are not routed to the interface and the Pin Control Register for these pins controls the
muxing. The pin control registers cannot route the JTAG interface to the pins. The system board designer should termi-
nate this pin in all functional states using jumpers, pullup or pulldown resistors, and so forth.
JTAG registers are set to their initial values by the assertion of the JTAG_RST# pin. The JTAG_RST# pin must be held
low while the CEC1702 devices are powering up so the registers can be set to their proper default values. If JTAG_RST#
is high during power up, the JTAG registers may be set to unpredictable values. This can trigger unwanted test modes
and the system may not run correctly. As a result, the JTAG_RST# pin must be held low for at least 5.00 msec when
applying VTR power.

  Note:     For more details on the JTAG_RST# pin, in particular JTAG_RST# functionality with respect to VTR power
            up events, as well as RESETI# reset input pin transitions, see the JTAG section in the CEC1702 Data
            Sheet.



The minimum required JTAG signals as shown in Table 3-1 does not include the JTAG_RST# signal. There are several
options to handle the absence of this pin as followed:
• Production Mode with JTAG Port Disable:
  - Hold the JTAG_RST# pin low with pulldown resistor to disable the JTAG port. Add a pullup resistor option (do
    not populate) for potential failure analysis to allow use of the JTAG interface. In this case, the JTAG_RST# pin
    must be manually held low at least 5.00 msec on power up.

• Production Mode with JTAG Port Enable:
  - Add a jumper to hold the JTAG_RST# line low during power up, then remove the jumper in order to ensure
    that it meets the 5.00 msec timing requirement.
Optionally, put in hardware Resistor-Capacitor (RC) circuitry to force the JTAG_RST# signal low for at least 5.00 msec.
For example:
1.    Use a CEC1702 EVB with external power supply which shows the rise time less than 100µs.
2.    RC = 100K ohms resistor pullup to VTR and 1µF capacitor.
3.    The rising timing of VTR related to the JTAG_RST# signal is shown in Figure 3-3; the falling time should be a
      reverse of the rising time.

     Note:   The RC values need to be changed in order to compensate for the power supply time to provide a 5.00
             msec reset pulse, measured from VTR = 3.3V to JTAG_RST# = 0.8V.

GENERAL LAYOUT CONSIDERATIONS
This section describes layout considerations for the MEC142x devices. This includes the following topics:
• Decoupling Capacitors on page 2
• 32.768kHz Crystal Oscillator on page 6
• CAP Pins, AVSS/GND Connection on page 7
• BGA Package PCB Layout Considerations on page 7

Decoupling Capacitors
This section includes the following topics:
• MEC142x VTQFP Capacitors on page 2
• MEC142x WFBGA Capacitors on page 4
Decoupling capacitors should be placed as close to the chip as possible to keep series inductance low. When the capac-
itors are mounted on the bottom side of the PCB, the capacitors are connected to the ground plane from the bottom
layer directly using the shortest path to the device. Each VTR pin should have a 0.1 F capacitor located as close to the
pin as possible. Bypass capacitors should be placed close to the supply pins of the MEC142x with short and wide traces.
The MEC142x has an integrated voltage regulator to supply the core circuitry. Decoupling this regulator requires a crit-
ical capacitor of 1F on the CAP pin. ESR of this 1F capacitor, including the routing resistance, must be less than 100
mOhm.
Capacitors may carry large currents that generate magnetic fields, inducing noise on nearby traces. Sensitive traces
such as the 32kHz crystal should be separated by at least five times the trace width from decoupling capacitors when
possible.
Connecting decoupling caps to power and ground planes using two vias per pad will reduce series inductance.

• FIGURE 2: on page 4 shows decoupling for the MEC142x 144-pin WFBGA.
• FIGURE 3: on page 5 shows decoupling for the MEC142x 128-Pin WFBGA.
The VTR pin decoupling capacitors can use any typical 16V 10% Ceramic. Also see the MEC142x EVB Schematics
and Bill of Materials.

32.768kHz Crystal Oscillator
This section describes specific layout and design considerations for the 32.768kHz crystal oscillator; this can be used
to source the internal 32kHz clock domain, in lieu of the silicon oscillator or an external pin. The crystal implementation
is required to support the RTC function within the MEC142x.

32.768KHZ CRYSTAL OSCILLATOR LAYOUT
The MEC142x 32kHz crystal oscillator is designed to generate an synchronous on-chip clock signal with an appropriate
external oscillator crystal. The design has been optimized for low power (1.5 μW typical), stability and minimum jitter
using a general purpose parallel resonant 32kHz crystal. For a suggested part number, please see the MEC142x EVB
schematic (see References).
This unique low power crystal oscillator drive circuit means that a standard inverter crystal layout should not be used.
The design has been characterized to allow a variation of 4pF to 18pF on each pin. Based on the following load capac-
itance calculation, Microchip recommends 10pf load capacitors with a crystal that has a 9pf Cl rating. Other than these
capacitors, no additional external components are required for normal operation of the clock circuit.




Where:
• C12 is the cap from pin XTAL1 to ground.
• C13 is the cap from pin XTAL2 to ground.
• Cpin_xtal2 is the pin capacitance of pin XTAL2. This is estimated to be 5pf (Note 1:).
• Cpin_xtal1 is the pin capacitance of pin XTAL1. This is estimated to be 3pf (Note 1:).
• Cbrd is estimated at 1.5pF.
  Note 1: At the time of publication, the MEC142x silicon has not been characterized. Please check with your Micro-
          chip FAE for final pin capacitance values after silicon validation is complete. Any variation from the estimates
          provided here could change the crystal Cl value requirement.

CRYSTAL ACCURACY
The accuracy of the 32kHz input translates directly into accuracy of the internal clock and the functions in the MEC142x
using the 32kHz: 32KHZ_OUT, week timer, hibernation timers, and so forth.
The accuracy, with regard to actual error in time can be illustrated as such: +/-1ppm of error in frequency corresponds
to 32.768 kHz x 1ppm x 10-6 = +/-0.032768 Hz. This translates into ~1 µsec/sec or ~+/-0.086 sec/day.
Based on customer RTC accuracy timer requirements, Microchip recommends using a +/-20ppm crystal. This would
equal approximately +/-2 sec/day, other factors discounted.
For arguments sake, it is safe to say that stray capacitance is difficult to calculate exactly. So, as an exercise in com-
pleteness, this calculation describes the effect of each picofarad of additional capacitance over/under the crystal Cload
value:




where C0 is the shunt capacitance, C1 is the motional capacitance and CL is the load capacitance of the chosen crystal
(these numbers can be found in the crystal data sheet). For example, using a crystal with C0 = 0.8pF, C1 = 0.0019pF,
CL = 12.5pF, we get a shift of 5.37ppm/pF. So, in terms of time, each pF of added/subtracted capacitance is approxi-
mately 5.37 x 0.086 = +/-462 msec/day for this particular crystal.
This example is meant to illustrate the magnitude of the potential error. In practice, slight capacitance mismatch does
not equate to many seconds a day.

SINGLE ENDED CLOCKING
An external clock source (maximum voltage of 3.3V) may be applied to the XTAL2 pin if the XOSEL bit in Clock Enable
Register configures as a single-ended 32.768 kHz clock input (SUSCLK). The XTAL1 pin should be left floating. If an
external clock source is used, the designer must ensure that the source is available in all desired power states in which
the EC will be active.

CAP Pins, AVSS/GND Connection
The recommended filtering for the CAP pin on the MEC142x is shown in Figure 4, for VTQFP connections. The filtering
components shown should be close to the device and away from noise sources.

BGA Package PCB Layout Considerations
The MEC142x devices have BGA lead-free RoHS-Compliant package as follows:
• 128-pin WFBGA Lead-free RoHS Compliant Package (see Figure 6)
• 144-pin WFBGA Lead-free RoHS Compliant Package (see Figure 5)

  Note:     Please refer to the latest data sheet for most up-to-date PCB LAND pattern information.

The following list summarizes BGA routing guidelines, but it is understood that final layout is process- dependent and
your design should reflect your needs:
• Through-hole vias technology is not recommended for pitches less than 0.8mm (unless the ball matrix is depopu-
  lated in the center)
• NSMD ball pads for pitches 0.8mm – 0.4mm
• Solder Mask to be 1:1 scale of the land size, when routing 0.5mm pitch ball pads
• Vias – next generation PCB technology for tighter pitches
• Eliminate through-hole vias
• Increase routing density & enhance electrical performance
• Decrease routing layers
• Provide fan-out solutions for multiple layers (stacked Vias)

LPC Interface
The firmware must configure the GPIO Pin Control Registers for the LPC alternate function, configure the LPC Base
Address Register, and activate the LPC block.

VTR_LPC_ESPI POWER PIN
The LPC Interface Signals require the VTR_LPC_ESPI power pin to be connected to the 3.3V VTR rail. Please also
configure the VTR_LPC_ESPI_SEL18 bit 3 at Power Regions Voltage Control Register (0xFC48) accordingly.

HOST RESET SELECT
The platform reset signal that will be used to assert nSIO_RSET is determined by the POWER RESET CONTROL Reg-
ister (80148h) Bit 1 = 0 - LRESET# pin.

LAD[3:0] /LFRAME#/ LDRQ#/SERIRQ
The AC and DC specifications for these signals are set the same as defined for AD[31:0] in Section 4.2.2 of the “PCI
Local Bus Specification, Rev 2.1”. That section contains the specifications for the 3.3V signaling environment. LAD[3:0]
must go high during the TAR phase. The last device driving the LAD[3:0] is responsible to drive the signals high during
the first clock of the TAR phase. During the 2nd clock, LAD[3:0] is floated and maintained high by weak pullup resistors
(approximately 100 k ). These pullups are not included in the MEC142x, but may be included in the chipset.

OTHER SIGNALS
All the other LPC I/F signals are connected to other PCI signals that are already present in the system. The MEC142x
use 3.3V signaling for all LPC signals, including the PCI Reset and Clock, therefore the system must drive these signals
at 3.3V signaling levels.

eSPI Interface
The firmware must configure the GPIO Pin Control Registers for the eSPI alternate function, configure the eSPI I/O
Component Base Address Register, and activate the eSPI block.

VTR_LPC_ESPI POWER PIN
The eSPI Interface signals require the VTR_LPC_ESPI power pin to be connected to the 1.8V rail. Please also configure
the VTR_LPC_ESPI_SEL18 bit 3 at Power Regions Voltage Control Register (0xFC48) accordingly.

HOST RESET SELECT
The platform reset signal that will be used to assert nSIO_RSET is determined by the POWER RESET CONTROL Reg-
ister (80148h) Bit 1 = 1 - eSPI_PLTRST# pin.

OTHER SIGNALS
All the eSPI I/F signals are connected to other eSPI signals that are already present in the system. The MEC142x use
1.8V signaling for all eSPI signals. Please refer to the Intel Skylake Ultrabook Platform U-Series RVP Customer Refer-
ence Board Schematic, Microchip MEC142x Evaluation Board Schematic, and reworks instruction for detailed informa-
tion.
Few design notes as below:
• LPC_AD0_ESPI_IO0, LPC_AD1_ESPI_IO1, LPC_AD2_ESPI_IO2, LPC_AD3_ESPI_IO3, LPC_-
  FRAME_ESPI_CS#, and LPC_CLK_0_ESPI_CLK signals have 15 ohm series resistor close to each chipset pin
  and another 15 ohm series resistor close to the MEC142x for eSPI mode.
• GPP_C5/SML0ALERT# (Intel Skylake chipset pin W1) is used as ping pin to determine either LPC mode (Low) or
  eSPI mode (High).

AN2407
PS/2 Interface
The routing of the PS/2 interface is also not critical, except that it should not be routed next to rapidly switching signals.
The Clock and Data pins are Open Drain and require pullup resistors. A small 10 - 100pF (typ) capacitor to ground and
4.7k (typ) pullups are recommended. The power pin of the PS/2 pin should be decoupled with a capacitor that is large
enough to adequately filter the supply to PS/2 devices. Unused PS/2 clock and data pins should be pulled up to VTR
with a 10k (typ) resistor.

  Note:     The PS/2 Interface is not 5V tolerant.


EOS Considerations
For SMBus signals that terminate external to the main system board (for example, Smart Battery) the designer should
take care in protecting these signals from EOS (Note 1:) and ESD (Note 2:). Please refer to the SMBus 2.0 specification,
section 3.1.2.2 for appropriate guidelines. The specification recommends a series protection resistor and an optional
ESD transorb on these nets. In addition to the SMBus specification recommendation, past experience shows that using
2 high speed diodes on each SMBus trace (instead of the transorb in the SMBus spec) is an effective way to improve
immunity to EOS and ESD events. A Schottky diode pair is a good example. Figure 8 shows the suggested circuit imple-
mentation for each net that goes to a connector.


FIGURE 8:            SCHOTTKY DIODE PAIR EXAMPLE




It should also be noted that any other signal that goes to an external connector should also be considered for EOS/ESD
susceptibility. For instance, an ID pin (tied to a GPIO) that might seem benign, but is routed near high voltage sources
could suffer transient EOS events. A similar protection scheme should be considered for these nets.
  Note 1: EOS is defined as damage to the part caused by the application of voltages (to any pin) beyond the power
          supply rails, usually forward biasing internal protection diodes and resulting in high levels of current flow.
          This typically induces open failures by damaging the metal inside the part. EOS is typically a low voltage,
          high current situation.
        2: ESD is the applied reverse bias to the PN junction -- heat due to power dissipation melts the silicon in the
           part. ESD is typically a high transient voltage spike with low current situation.

ADC Input Layout Requirement for Regular Sampling
ADC has a large internal resistance.
Every ADC input terminal has a gate switch.
This gate switch is protected by diodes.
It is natural for diodes have leakage current.


At sampling time: (Gate switch closed)
Input voltage is charged and sampled at sample point A.
Sampling time is affected by RC time constant defined by internal resistor and internal capacitor.


In continuous mode, the sampling time is too fast for sample point A to discharge sampled value. In this case, glitch will
not be observed.


In one shot mode or in long report mode, the sampling time is long enough for point A to discharge sampled value.
In this case, glitch will be observed on the next sampling point.


If an external capacitor with value between 0.1uF and 0.01uF (point C2) is placed on the input terminal, the charged
value at point A will be kept as it is instead of discharging it and then glitch will not be observed.


For high sampling frequencies, it is recommend to set the cut off frequency of the R/C at ½ of the ADC sampling fre-
quency / 10.

SPI Flash Interface
The MEC142x SPI flash interface enables the host and embedded controller (EC) access to an external SPI flash
device. The MEC142x PCS documentation has more details on signal implementation (see References on page 1). This
section describes specific PCB layout design considerations to setup this feature.
The standard set of SPI flash signals are designated with “SHD_” for shared connections, for example, SHD_SCLK; for
details, see Shared SPI Flash Interface on page 15. MEC142x has an added set of signals for connection to another
SPI flash device as private, protected data; these signals are designated with “PVT_,” for example, PVT_SCLK; for
details, see Private SPI Flash Interface on page 17. The Private SPI can be used as a crisis recovery interface as it
shares pins with the keyboard interface. MEC142x has a third SPI interface as a general SPI interface labeled as “SPI_,”
for example, SPI_CLK.

  Note:     The SHD SPI Flash Interface of MEC142x support both 1.8V & 3.3V depends on VTR_33_18 power pin
            setting. The PVT SPI Flash Interface of MEC142x support 3.3V ONLY. Please refer to data sheet for more
            information.

BOOT ROM STRAP OPTION
• If the CR_STRAP pin is connected to ground the Boot ROM will load the SPI Flash image from the SPI Flash
  located on the Private SPI Interface (PVT_xxxx).
• If this pin is pulled high, which is the normal operation for the Key Scan Interface, the Boot ROM will load the SPI
  Flash image from the Shared Flash Interface (SHD_xxxx) or the eSPI Flash channel as selected by the Boot
  Source Select Strap (BSS_STRAP) on the GPIO123/SHD_CS0# pin.

PRIMARY RAILS GOOD STRAP
The Primary Rails Good Strap option (PRG_STRAP) is implemented on GPIO135/SHD_IO2[PRG_STRAP]. This strap
is used for booting from the eSPI flash channel using Master Attached Flash Sharing (MAFS).

VOLTAGE LEVEL STRAP
The Voltage Level Strap option (VL_STRAP) is implemented on GPIO117/TFDP_CLK/UART_TX[VL_STRAP].
The VL_STRAP pin is used to indicate to the boot ROM what the voltage level is on the pins in the region that is powered
by the VTR_33_18 supply. This pin must be pulled up to 3.3V (VTR) to indicate the region is at 3.3V; and pulled low to
indicate the region is 1.8V.

SHARED SPI FLASH INTERFACE

Shared SPI Flash Implementation:
Figure 10 is a topology for implementing a single MEC142x SPI flash for shared SPI flash devices. See Table 2 for spec-
ifications on PCB trace recommendations represented by “L1,” “L2,” and so forth.

  Note:     In order for the Core Logic to be controlled by the RSMRST# signal, the PCH Primary Power Rails are
            required to be powered along with the EC. Otherwise, the isolation circuit will be needed in the Shared SPI
            implementation.

PRIVATE SPI FLASH INTERFACE

  Note:     Either Shared SPI or Private SPI interface can support a dedicated SPI chip. The Private SPI is targeted
            for use as a crisis recovery option since it is muxed with keyscan pins.

Private SPI Flash Implementation:
Figure 11 is a topology for implementing the MEC142x SPI flash for a single private SPI flash device. See Table 3 for
specifications on PCB trace recommendations represented by “L1,” “L2,” and so forth.

SPI FLASH IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS
The following recommendations are for both Shared and Private SPI Flash Implementations.
• The MEC142x SPI memory interface has serial flash device compatibility requirements that are defined in the
  MEC142x PCS. Please make sure the selected SPI flash meets these requirements.
• SPI_CLK must be 20mils spacing from any other high frequency (>1GHz) signal.
• The SPI flash parts should support operating at 8.5MHz for the ROM code loader, and up to 33MHz clock speed in
  RAM code loading.
• The designer should follow the SPI interface host design guidelines.
• IBIS models are available to aid in simulating the SPI system topology.
• The chip select CS# signals should have weak pullup resistors to the same power rail as the SPI flash. The pullup
  resistor value should meet the rise time requirements of the SPI flash.
• EC firmware must configure the MEC142x SPI memory interface to disable mode, which will tri-state the SPI
  memory interface from MEC142x to the SPI flash, before releasing the RSMRST# signal.
• This configuration requires that the PCH tri-state its SPI flash pins when RSMRST# is asserted.
• The characteristic impedance of the PCB trace should be 50 ohms +/-15% at 50MHz operating frequency.
• Within the SPI flash device, Schmitt trigger inputs are assumed on both the clock line and IO data lines.
• Within the Intel PCH, a Schmitt trigger input is assumed on the IO data lines.
• The output drivers for the SPI flash chip select pins should be programmed as open-drain using the GPIO Pin
  Control registers.
• The SPI Data IO traces should be length-matched to the CLK lines within 0.100-inch.
• Signal Integrity should be checked for each SPI part on your BOM.

SPI FLASH EXTERNAL PROGRAMMER
The SPI Flash on either Shared or Private SPI Flash interface must be programmed externally using a suitable program-
mer, such as Dediprog’s SF100 (http://www.dediprog.com/pd/spi-flash-solution/sf100).
Provisions for a programming header on each SPI flash are recommended if the SPI is not socketed.

1MHz Pullup Resistor Requirement
Please refer to the I2C-bus specification and user manual as indicated in References on page 1 for more information.

5V Tolerant Pins
There are no 5V tolerant pins on the MEC142x.

1.8V Capability
Please refer to the MEC142x Data Sheet section 2.6 for more information.

  Note:
• The LPC Interface Signals require the VTR_LPC_ESPI power pin to be connected to the 3.3V VTR rail. The eSPI
  Interface signals require the VTR_LPC_ESPI power pin to be connected to the 1.8V rail. The GPIO signals on
  these pins may operate at either 1.8V or 3.3V. Please also configure the VTR_LPC_ESPI_SEL18 bit 3 at Power
  Regions Voltage Control Register (0xFC48) accordingly.
• The SMB00 to SMB04 Ports have the option to be configured for either 3.3V or 1.8V signaling. This selection is
  determined by the GPIO alternate function mux.

COMPARATOR VOLTAGE OUTPUT CALCULATION
Use Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law with assumption I2 = 0, ideal condition with some small leakage in uAmps region.

EQUATION 1:         AT ROOM TEMP
- 3.3V + I1 (100K) + I1 (100K) + I1 (1K) + 2.69V = 0
I1 (201K) = 0.66V
I1 = 3.3uAmps
100K x 3.3uAmps = 0.3V
3.3V - 0.3V = 3V at Room Temperature

EQUATION 2:         JUST BEFORE TRIP POINT
- 3.3V + I1 (100K) + I1 (100K) + I1 (1K) + 1.1V = 0
I1 (201K) = 2.2V
I1 = 11uAmps
100K x 11uAmps = 1.1V
3.3V - 1.1V = 2.2V at Just Before Trip Point

EQUATION 3:          JUST BEFORE TRIP POINT
- 2.2V + I1(100K) + I1(1K) + 1.1V = 0
I1 (101K) = 1.1V
I1 = 11uAmps
VIN = 11uAmps (1K) +1.1V = 1.111V

EQUATION 4:         AFTER TRIP POINT
1.1V = 100K / 101K (VIN)
VIN = 1.089
As the results, the hysteresis is +/- 11mV, total 22mV between 1.111V to 1.089V.

CONCLUSION
• Based on the 100K and 1K external feedback resistor values chosen, the nominal is +/- 11m and the total of 22mV
  hysteresis.
• The output of the comparator is ~3V at room temperature.
• The output of the open drain comparator at just before trip point is 2.2V, which is still high enough based on fact of
  the circuitry.
• Trip point at ~ 82C, based on a typical 100K NTC Thermistor resistance numbers from the thermistor data sheet.

HOW TO SET UP ADC VOLTAGE STATES TO DISTINGUISH PC MODEL AND PCB
TYPES
This section provides general guidelines regarding how to use the ADC input to distinguish the PC models and PCB
types in the design as follows:
1.   Ensure choosing resistor values taking into account the effects of the ADC input impedance (refer to MEC142x
     Data Sheet for more information).
2.   Make sure the tolerance of the large resistors are taken into account.
3.   Final calculated voltages taking into account of the ADC input impedance and Resistor tolerance should give the
     designer a range of voltages for each resistor set, then make sure there is enough voltage separation to distin-
     guish (accounting for anticipated system noise and accuracy of ADC input resolution), recommends a minimum
     of 250mV between ADC steps for a robust design.
4.   Adjust resistor (such as lower value of resistors used, or use a better tolerance if needed) if step 3 is not satis-
     factory.

Reference Example
This section shows the calculation and suggestion based on the above guideline.

PWM CONTROLLED 3-WIRE FAN
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) modules, which produce basically digital waveforms, can be used in many applications
as a more efficient and lower power alternative to the traditional 8 bit Digital-to-Analog (D/A) converters using only two
inexpensive filter components. A wide variety of microcontroller applications that exist today are better served by utiliz-
ing a PWM generated analog output as opposed to an 8 bit D/A converter. One application where using a high resolution
PWM has value vs. a traditional 8 Bit DAC is in driving the 3-wire voltage controlled fan in a PC.
The typical schematic of a 3 wire fan drive is shown in Figure 16 by PWM.

  Note:     The DAC should be remained disabled to save ~1mA power.

MEC142X SHARED SPI FLASH ISOLATION REQUIREMENT
The MEC142x uses the GPIO123/SHD_CS0#/[BSS_STRAP] pin as a strap to determine the boot source (eSPI Flash
channel or shared SPI).


There is a new requirement to put isolation on the board if the Shared SPI flash is used so that the SPI_CS# is detected
high while RSMRST# is low.


This requirement is due to the following information in the current Intel PCH device specification regarding the
SPI0_CS0# pin:
SPI0_CS0# is pulled low instead of high (internally in the PCH).
The “pull” strength is about 1K ohms.


One example of a recommended isolation circuit requires an external tri-state buffer, so that the pull-up for the strap can
be of reasonable strength. One possible buffer is the 74LVC1G125 which has a small propagation delay that will not
impact the timing of the existing Boot ROM code.


The buffer and pull-up on the SHD_CS# pin is shown in the figure below.




                                                                         3.3V (VccPRIM)

    Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
    •    Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.

    •    Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
         intended manner and under normal conditions.

    •    There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
         knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
         Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.

    •    Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.

    •    Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
         mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”

    Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
    products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
    allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.

OVERVIEW

Description

Philips Semiconductors developed the I2C bus over 20 years ago and has an extensive collection of specific use and
general purpose devices. This application note was developed from the 3 hour long I2C Overview TecForum presentation
at DesignCon 2003 in San Jose, CA on 27 January 2003 and provides a broad overview of how the I2C bus compares to
other serial buses, how the I2C bus works, ways to overcome previous limitations, new uses of I2C such as in the
Intelligent Platform Management Interface, overview of the various different categories of I2C devices and patent/royalty
information. Full size Slides are posted as a PDF file on the Philips Logic I2C collateral web site as DesignCon 2003
TecForum I2C Bus Overview PDF file. Place holder and title slides have been removed from this application note and
some slides with all text have been incorporated into the application note speaker notes.

 •    Defined by Intel, Microsoft, …                                                       •   Up to 127 devices can be connected together
 •    Intended to replace the large number of legacy ports in the PC                       •   Push for USB to become THE standard on PCs
 •    Single master (= Host) system with up to 127 peripherals                                 – standard for iMac, supported by Windows, now on > 99%of PCs

 •    Simple plug and play; no need to open the PC                                         • Interfaces (bridges) to other communication channels

Each device has a unique 7-bit or 10-bit I2C address.
For 7-bit devices, typically the first four bits are fixed,                          •       P (STOP) - data transfer is terminated by a stop
the next three bits are set by hardware address pins (A0,                                    condition, (not a stop bit). This occurs when the
A1, and A2) that allow the user to modify the I2C                                            level on the SDA data line passes from the low
address allowing up to eight of the same devices to                                          state to the high state, while the SCL clock line
operate on the I2C bus. These pins are held high to VCC,                                     remains high. When the data transfer has been
sometimes through a resistor, or held low to GND.                                            terminated, the bus is free once again.

The last bit of the initial byte indicates if the master is
going to send (write) or receive (read) data from the
slave. Each transmission sequence must begin with the
start condition and end with the stop condition.
On the 8th clock pulse, SDA is set ‘high’ if data is
going to be read from the other device, or ‘low’ if data
is going to be sent (write). During its 9th clock, the

•       Functional blocks on the block diagram correspond                                The bus can become hung for several reasons, e.g.….
        with the actual ICs; designs proceed rapidly from                                    1. Incorrect power-up and/or reset procedure for
        block diagram to final schematic.                                                        ICs
•       No need to design bus interfaces because the I2C                                     2. Power to a chip is interrupted – brown-outs etc
        bus interface is already integrated on-chip.                                         3. Noise on the wiring causes false clock or data
•       Integrated addressing and data-transfer protocol                                         signals
        allow systems to be completely software-defined.

The PCA9515 can be used for this purpose. One side of
the device will have all the devices running at 400 kHz
while the other side will have all the devices running to
100 kHz.

different logic voltage levels. For example, the “older”
100 kHz devices can run at 5.0 V while the “newer”
400 kHz devices can work at 3.3 V.

          – Simple programming
          – Easy to implement
      – Inconvenient:
          – Need to continually send ON/OFF commands through I2C
          – 1 microcontroller’s timer required to perform the task
          – I2C bus can be tied up by commands if many LEDs to be controlled
          – Blinking is lost if the I2C bus hangs
 • 2nd approach: I2C LED Blinkers
      – Advantage:
          – One time programmable (frequency, duty cycle)
          – Internal oscillator
          – Easy to implement
          – Device does not need I2C bus once programmed and turned on

List of Nominal Resistance Values
The nominal resistance values of ROHM’s resistors are determined (with some exceptions) based on the number series referred
to as the E series, which is an international standard established by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Marking
codes of resistor values also comply with an IEC standard. This application note provides a list of nominal resistance values and
an overview of the standards.

5. Standards overview

5-1. E series
The international standard IEC 60063 specifies series of
                                                                                                  Theoretical numbers
preferable numbers for resistor values. The E series have a
                                                                               10.00 14.68 21.54 31.62 46.42 68.13                     100
certain number (r) of numerical values every 10n (nth power of
10) and are represented as “Er” based on the number of
numerical values. r is determined from a formula, r = 3 × 2 i,
where i is an integer (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6). Based on this                                            E6 Series
calculation, r is 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, or 192. For example, if the                10        15     22       33       47    68         100
series has 24 numerical values every 10n (10 or more and less
than 100), it is referred to as “E24”. The E3, E6, E12, E24, E48,
E96, and E192 series are commonly used.

                                                                               0

 2. S-parameter (1/3)

S-parameter library provides the S-parameter data which could be used in circuit designs.
Below are the details of the procedure for measuring S-parameter data, the applied land pattern, the
measurement equipment, and the measurement conditions for capacitors.

1. Measurement Procedure
   The measurement procedure is indicated below. The S-parameter data is measured with two ports
   using a network analyzer and measurement jig, as shown mainly in Fig. 1.
                                                                                                    Network Analyzer
  (1) Correction
      Two kinds of correction, SOLT (partly SOL) and TRL, are used.
      SOLT applies Murata’s original land pattern (Short, Open, Load, and
      Thru).
      Meanwhile, TRL uses Murata’s original land pattern (Thru, Reflect,
      Line, Match).
                                                                                                        Measurement
  (2) Measurement                                                                                        Equipment
      After soldering the capacitor to the land pattern, we fix it to a
      measurement jig connected to a network analyzer, impedance analyzer,
      and measure it.

  (3) Extraction of S-parameter data for the capacitor alone                             Fig.1 Measurement of
                                                                                            S-parameter data
      In the S-parameter data, although the characteristics of the land pattern
      and measurement equipment are eliminated by correction and electrical delay, the characteristics of

 3. DC Bias Characteristics (1/2)

The capacitance of multilayer ceramic chip capacitors changes when DC bias voltage is applied.
There are two types of multilayer ceramic capacitors: capacitors for temperature compensation and
high dielectric constant capacitors. Capacitors for temperature compensation (C0G type etc.) hardly
change when DC bias voltage is applied. On the other hand, the high dielectric constant type (X5R
type etc.) changes when DC bias voltage is applied. Fig.3 shows an example of the DC bias
characteristics of the C0G type and X5R type.

 4. Temperature Characteristics (1/2)

The capacitance of multilayer ceramic chip capacitors changes with temperature. Therefore EIA
standards classify temperature characteristics. There are two types of chip multilayer ceramic
capacitors: capacitors for temperature compensation and high dielectric constant capacitors.
Capacitors for temperature compensation (C0G, NP0 type etc.) show little change in capacitance due
to temperature. On the other hand, the high dielectric constant type (X5R, X7R etc.) demonstrates a
typical change in temperature. Fig.6 shows an example of the temperature characteristics of the C0G
type and X5R type. Table.3 lists the operating temperature range and capacitance tolerance of the
C0G type and X5R type.

 5. Temperature Rise Characteristics (1/2)

When ripple current is applied to multilayer ceramic chip capacitors, the capacitor generates heat.
This internal temperature rise cannot be disregarded. While Murata does not guarantee a ripple
current rating, it is recommended that the temperature rise does not exceed 20℃. Fig.7 show a
temperature rise characteristics of high dielectric type of capacitors.

 6. AC Voltage Characteristics (1/2)

The capacitance of monolithic ceramic chip capacitors changes when AC voltage is applied.
Those capacitors are classified into temperature compensation type and high dielectric constant type.
The capacitance of the temperature compensation type (C0G, NP0 type, etc.) rarely changes when
AC voltage is applied. However, the capacitance of the high dielectric constant type (X5R) changes
when AC voltage is applied. Fig.9 shows the typical AC voltage data of both C0G and X5R types.

  AN-1149 Layout Guidelines for Switching Power Supplies
.....................................................................................................................................................

                                                                       ABSTRACT
        When designing a high frequency switching regulated power supply, layout is very important. Using a
        good layout can solve many problems associated with these types of supplies. The problems due to a bad
        layout are often seen at high current levels and are usually more obvious at large input to output voltage
        differentials. Some of the main problems are loss of regulation at high output current and/or large input to
        output voltage differentials, excessive noise on the output and switch waveforms, and instability. Using the
        simple guidelines that follow will help minimize these problems.

Inductor                                                                                                                     www.ti.com

1      Inductor
       Always try to use a low EMI inductor with a ferrite type closed core. Some examples would be toroid and
       encased E core inductors. Open core can be used if they have low EMI characteristics and are located a
       bit more away from the low power traces and components. It would also be a good idea to make the poles
       perpendicular to the PCB as well if using an open core. Stick cores usually emit the most unwanted noise.

2      Feedback
       Try to run the feedback trace as far from the inductor and noisy power traces as possible. You would also
       like the feedback trace to be as direct as possible and somewhat thick. These two sometimes involve a
       trade-off, but keeping it away from inductor EMI and other noise sources is the more critical of the two. It
       is often a good idea to run the feedback trace on the side of the PCB opposite of the inductor with a
       ground plane separating the two.

3      Filter Capacitors
       When using a low value ceramic input filter capacitor, it should be located as close to the VIN pin of the IC
       as possible. This will eliminate as much trace inductance effects as possible and give the internal IC rail a
       cleaner voltage supply. Some designs require the use of a feed-forward capacitor connected from the
       output to the feedback pin as well, usually for stability reasons. In this case it should also be positioned as
       close to the IC as possible. Using surface mount capacitors also reduces lead length and lessens the
       chance of noise coupling into the effective antenna created by through-hole components.

4      Compensation
       If external compensation components are needed for stability, they should also be placed closed to the IC.
       Surface mount components are recommended here as well for the same reasons discussed for the filter
       capacitors. These should not be located very close to the inductor as well.

5      Traces and Ground Plane
       Make all of the power (high current) traces as short, direct, and thick as possible. It is a good practice on a
       standard PCB board to make the traces an absolute minimum of 15 mils (0.381mm) per Ampere. The
       inductor, output capacitors, and output diode should be as close to each other possible. This helps reduce
       the EMI radiated by the power traces due to the high switching currents through them. This will also
       reduce lead inductance and resistance as well, which in turn reduces noise spikes, ringing, and resistive
       losses that produce voltage errors. The grounds of the IC, input capacitors, output capacitors, and output
       diode (if applicable) should be connected close together directly to a ground plane. It would also be a
       good idea to have a ground plane on both sides of the PCB. This will reduce noise as well by reducing
       ground loop errors as well as by absorbing more of the EMI radiated by the inductor. For multi-layer
       boards with more than two layers, a ground plane can be used to separate the power plane (where the
       power traces and components are) and the signal plane (where the feedback and compensation and
       components are) for improved performance. On multi-layer boards the use of vias will be required to
       connect traces and different planes. It is good practice to use one standard via per 200 mA of current if
       the trace will need to conduct a significant amount of current from one plane to the other.
       Arrange the components so that the switching current loops curl in the same direction. Due to the way
       switching regulators operate, there are two power states. One state when the switch is on and one when
       the switch is off. During each state there will be a current loop made by the power components that are
       currently conducting. Place the power components so that during each of the two states the current loop is
       conducting in the same direction. This prevents magnetic field reversal caused by the traces between the
       two half-cycles and reduces radiated EMI.

6      Heat Sinking
       When using a surface mount power IC or external power switches, the PCB can often be used as the
       heatsink. This is done by simply using the copper area of the PCB to transfer heat from the device. For
       information on using the PCB as a heatsink for that particular device, see the device-specific data sheet.
       This can often eliminate the need for an externally attached heatsink.

       These guidelines apply for any inductive switching power supply. These include step-down (Buck), step-up
       (Boost), Flyback, inverting Buck/Boost, and SEPIC among others. The guidelines are also useful for linear
       regulators, that also use a feedback control scheme, that are used in conjunction with switching regulators
       or switched capacitor converters. Some layout pictures are included: Figure 1 shows step-up switching
       regulator schematic to be used for some layout examples. Figure 2 is an example of a bad layout that

1      Introduction
       One problem with writing an application report on PCB layout is that the people who read it are usually not
       the ones who are going to use it. Even if the designer has struggled through electromagnetic fields, EMC,
       EMI, board parasitics, transmission line effects, grounding, and so on, he will in all probability then go on
       with his primary design task, leaving the layout to the CAD/layout person. Unfortunately, especially when it
       comes to switching regulators, it is not enough to be concerned with just basic routing/connectivity and
       mechanical issues. Both the designer and the CAD person need to be aware that the design of a
       switching power converter is only as good as its layout. Which probably explains why a great many of
       customer calls received, concerning switcher applications, are ultimately traced to poor layout practices.
       Sadly, these could and should have been avoided on the very first prototype board, saving time and
       money on all sides.
       The overall subject of PCB design is an extremely wide one, embracing several
       test/mechanical/production issues and also in some cases compliance/regulatory issues. There is also a
       certain amount of physics/electromagnetics involved, if a clearer understanding is sought. But the purpose
       of this application report is to reach the audience most likely to use it. Though there is enough design
       information for the more experienced designer/CAD person, the application report includes a quick-set of
       clear and concise basic rules that should be scrupulously followed to avoid a majority of problems. In
       particular, we have provided recommended starting points for layout when using the popular LM267x,
       LM259x and LM257x families (Figure 1) The focus is on the step-down (Buck) Simple Switcher ICs from
       Texas Instruments, but the same principles hold for any topology and switching power application.
       Most of the issues discussed in this application report revolve around simply assuring the desired
       performance in terms of basic electrical functionality. Though luckily, as the beleaguered switcher designer
       will be happy to know, in general all the electrical aspects involved are related and point in the same
       general ‘direction’. So for example, an ‘ideal’ layout, that is, one that helps the IC function properly, also
       leads to reduced electromagnetic emissions, and vice-versa. For example, reducing the area of loops with
       switching currents will help in terms of EMI and performance. However the designer is cautioned that
       there are some exceptions to this general 'trend'. One which is brought out in some detail here is the
       practice of 'copper-filling', which may help reduce parasitic inductances and reduce noise-induced IC
       problems, but can also increase EMI.

2      Quick-Set of Rules for SIMPLE SWITCHER® PCB Layout (Buck)
       1. Place the catch diode and input capacitor as shown in Figure 1.
       2. For high-speed devices (for example, LM267x) do not omit placing input decoupling/bypass ceramic
          capacitor (0.1 µF–0.47 µF) as in Figure 1.
       3. Connect vias to a Ground plane if available (optional, marked ‘X’ in Figure 1).
       4. If vias fall under tab of SMT power device, these are considered ‘thermal vias’. Use correct dimensions
          as discussed to avoid production issues. Or place the vias close to but not directly under the tab.
       5. Route feedback trace correctly as discussed, away from noise sources such as the inductor and the
          diode.
       6. Do not increase width of copper on switching node injudiciously.
       7. If very large heatsink area is required for catch diode (having estimated the heatsink requirement
          correctly) use isolation as discussed.
       8. For higher power SMT applications, use 2 oz board for better thermal management with less copper
          area.

3      AC and DC Current Paths
       Referring to Figure 2a, the bold lines represents the main (power) current flow in the converter during the
       time the switch is ON. As the switch turns ON, the edge of the of the current waveform is provided largely
       by CBYPASS, the remainder coming mainly from CIN. Some slower current components come from the
       input DC power supply (not shown) and also refresh these input caps. Figure 2b represents the situation
       when the switch is OFF. We can therefore see that in certain trace sections, current has to start flowing
       suddenly during the instant of switch turn-off and in some sections it needs to stop flowing equally
       suddenly. Figure 2c represents the ‘difference’, that is, traces shown bold in Figure 2 are those where the
       current flow changes suddenly. During the turn-on transition the picture reverses, but the 'difference'
       trace sections are the same. Therefore during either switch transition, 'step changes' of current take place
       in these difference sections. These traces encounter the harmonic-rich rising or trailing edges of the
       current pedestal waveform. The difference traces are considered 'critical' and deserve utmost attention
       during PCB layout. It is often stated colloquially, that ‘AC current’ flows in these trace sections, and 'DC
       current' in the others. The reason is that the basic switching PWM frequency forms only a fraction of the
       total harmonic (Fourier) content of the current waveform in the 'AC' traces. In comparison, where ‘DC
       current’ flows, the current does not change in a stepped fashion and so the harmonic content is lower. It is
       also no surprise that the DC sections are those in series with the main inductor, because it is known that
       inductors have the property of preventing sudden changes in current (this is analogous to a capacitor
       which ‘resists’ sudden changes in voltage).

       Summing up: In switching regulator layout, it is the AC paths that are considered critical, whereas
       the DC paths are not. That is the only basic rule to be kept in mind, and from which all the others
       follow. This is also true for any topology. Perform an analysis of the current flow for any topology in the
       same manner as we did for the Buck, to find the 'difference traces': and these traces are by definition the
       'critical' ones for layout.
       What is the problem with step current changes anyway? In a resistor for example, this causes no
       unexpected/unidentifiable problem. The voltage is given by V=IR, and so for a given change of current,
       the voltage will change proportionally. For example, a 0.5 cm wide Cu trace of thickness 1.4 mil has a
       resistance of 1milliohm per cm length (at 20 ºC). So it seems that a 1 inch long trace with a current
       changeover of 1A, would produce a change in voltage of only 2.5 millivolts across the trace, which is
       insignificant enough to cause the control sections of most ICs to misbehave. But in fact the induced
       voltage is much larger. The important thing to realize is that traces of copper on a PCB, though barely
       resistive, are also inductive. Now, the oft-repeated thumb-rule is that ‘every inch of trace length has an
       inductance of about 20 nH’. Like the trace resistance, that too doesn’t seem much at first sight. But it is
       this rather minute inductance which is in fact responsible for a great many customer calls in SIMPLE
       SWITCHER applications!
       The equation for voltage across an inductance is V=L*dl/dt, and so the voltage does not depend on the
       current but on the rate of change of the current. This fact makes all the difference when the 1A change we
       spoke about occurs within a very short time. The induced voltage can be very high, even for small
       inductances and currents, if the dl/dt is high. A high dl/dt event occurs during transition from Figure 2a to
       Figure 2b (and back) in all the AC trace sections (shown bold in Figure 2c). The induced voltage spike
       appears across each affected trace, lasting for the duration of the crossover.
       To get a better feel for the numbers here: the change in current in the AC sections of a typical buck
       converter is about 1.2 times the load current during the switch turn-off transition and is about 0.8
       times the load current during the switch turn-on transition (for an 'optimally' designed Buck inductor,
       as per inductor design guidelines in the relevant Datasheets/Selection Software). The transition time is
       about 30 ns for high speed FET switchers like the LM267x, and is about 75 ns for the slower bipolar
       switchers like the LM259x series. This also incidentally means that the voltage spikes in the high-speed
       families can be more than twice that in the slower families, for a comparable layout and load. Therefore
       layout becomes all the more critical in high-speed switchers.
       So, one inch of trace switching say 1A of instantaneous current in a transition time of 30 ns gives 0.7V, as
       compared to 2.5mV (that we estimated on the basis of resistance alone). For 3A, and two inches of trace,
       the induced voltage 'tries' to be 4V! In Figure 2c, the small triangles along the sections indicate the
       direction of the momentary induced voltage, as the converter changes from the situation in Figure 2a to
       that in Figure 2b (switch turn-off). We can see that assuming that the ground pin of the IC is the reference
       point, the switching node (marked ‘SW’) tries to go negative (all its series trace sections adding up).
       Similarly the input pin (marked ‘VIN’ goes high through series contributions in all its related sections.
       Figure 2c represents the picture during the turn-off transition. During the turn-on transition all the induced
       voltage polarities shown are simply reversed. In that case, the VIN pin is dragged low, and the switching
       node pin is dragged high momentarily.
       The astute designer will recognize that this was to be expected since any inductance, even if it is parasitic,
       demands to be ‘reset’, which means that the volt-seconds during the on-time must equal and be opposite
       in sign to the volt-seconds during the off-time.The designer will also realize that till these parasitic trace
       inductances reset, they do not 'allow' the crossover to occur. So for example, traces which were carrying
       current prior to switch turn-off will 'insist' on carrying current till the voltage spikes force them to do
       otherwise. Similarly, the traces which need to start carrying current will 'refuse' to do so till the spikes
       across them force them to do likewise. Since switching losses are proportional to crossover time, even if
       these voltage spikes do not cause anomalous behavior, they can degrade efficiency. For example, in
       transformer-based flyback regulators, when the the primary number of turns is much larger than the
       secondary turns, designers may be surprised to learn how much the secondary side trace inductances
       alone can degrade efficiency. This is because any secondary side uncoupled (trace/transformer
       leakage) inductances reflect into the primary side as an equivalent parasitic inductance in series
       with the switch. This adds an additional term to the effective leakage as seen by the switch that
       equals the secondary inductance multiplied by square of the turns ratio (turns ratio being Np/Ns).
       Therefore the dissipation in the flyback clamp (zener/RCD) can increase dramatically, lowering efficiency.

       One lesson here is that though 'leakage inductance' (from traces or the transformer) is considered
       'uncoupled', in reality it can make its presence severely felt from one side of the transformer to the other.
       So it is not totally 'uncoupled' at all! In fact this happens to be the main reason why flybacks with low
       output voltages (high turns ratio) show poorer efficiency as compared to higher output flybacks. Therefore,
       reducing critical trace inductances is important for several reasons: efficiency, EMI, besides basic
       functionality.
       The momentary voltage spikes which last for the duration of the transition can be very hard to capture on
       an oscilloscope. But they may be presumed to be present if the IC is seen to be misbehaving for no
       'obvious reason'. These spikes, if present with sufficiently high amplitude, can propagate into the control
       sections of the IC causing what we call here a controller 'upset’. This leads to the observed performance
       anomalies, and in rare cases this can even cause device failure. Since none of these spike-related
       problems can be easily corrected, or band-aided, once the layout is initially bad, the important thing is to
       get the layout ‘right’ to start with.
       The designer may well ask, why is it that these step current changes are a problem with the parasitic trace
       inductances, and not with the main inductor of the Buck converter? That is because all inductors try to
       resist any sudden current change. But since the main inductor has a much larger inductance (and energy
       storage) as compared to the parasitic trace inductances, it therefore ends up ‘dominating’. From V × dt = L
       × dl we can also see that if L is large, a much higher voltseconds (V × dt) is required to cause a given
       change in current. The trace inductances therefore simply 'give in' first before the main inductor does. But
       they certainly don't go down without a fight...and the voltage spikes bear testimony to this!
       Notice that the currents in the signal traces in the schematic are not shown. For example those connected
       to the compensation node (marked ‘COMP’) or bootstrap (marked ‘BOOST’) carry relatively minute
       currents and therefore are not likely to cause upsets. They are therefore not critical and can be routed
       relatively ‘carelessly’. The feedback trace is an exception, and will be discussed later. The Ground pin of
       the IC is another potential entry point of noise pickup. Inexperienced designers often grossly under
       estimate the needs of this pin, particularly for Buck converters. They assume that since the main power
       flow in a Buck converter does not pass through the ground pin, the ‘current through the ground pin is very
       low’, and therefore the trace length leading up to this pin is not critical. In fact, though the average current
       through this pin is very low, the peak current or its dl/dt is not. Consider the switch driver as shown
       schematically in Figure 2. Clearly it needs to supply current to drive the switch. In any FET operated as a
       switch, large peak to peak instantaneous current spikes are needed to charge and discharge the gate
       capacitance. This is essential so as to cause the FET to switch fast, and this reduces the
       switching/crossover losses inside the switch and improves the overall efficiency of the converter. (Actually,
       in a practical IC, the ‘spike’ of current comes from the bootstrap capacitor, and then the bootstrap
       capacitor is quickly refreshed by the internal circuitry of the IC ---- it is the refresh current that passes
       through the ground pin). Further, as in any high-speed digital IC, parts of the internal circuitry, clocks,
       gates, comparators and so on, can turn on and off suddenly, leading to small but abrupt changes in the
       current through the ground pin. This can cause 'ground bounce' which in turn can lead to controller upsets.
       Therefore the length of the trace to the Ground pin also needs to be kept as small as possible. This also
       implies that the input capacitors, especially the bypass capacitor ‘CBYPASS’ should be placed very
       close to the IC, even for a Buck IC.

4      Placing Components ‘acap’ (as Close as Possible)
       One has heard this before: “component X needs to be ‘acap’ ”. Soon we are told the “component Y too
       needs to be ‘acap’ ”. Then “Z too”. And so on. Which would be physically impossible because matter
       cannot occupy the same place at the same time! So which one comes first? This is the million-dollar
       predicament always facing switcher layout.
       The troubling trace lengths are those indicated Figure 2c. To keep them small, clearly two components
       need to be acap. These are the input bypass capacitor and also the catch diode. Consider the input
       capacitor section first.
       In the schematic there are in two input capacitors shown. These are marked ‘CIN’ and ‘CBYPASS’
       respectively. The purpose of the total input capacitance is to reduce the voltage variations at the input pin.
       The variations are mainly due to the pulsed input current waveshape, as demanded by a Buck topology.
       Note that for this particular topology, the output capacitor current is smooth (because the inductor is in
       series with it). In a Boost topology the situation is reversed: that is, the input capacitor current is smooth
       and the current into the output capacitor is pulsed. This makes the demand for input decoupling less

       stringent than in a Buck (or Buck-Boost). In a Buck-Boost or 'flyback', both the input and the output
       capacitor currents are pulsed, and input decoupling is required not only for the control-section/drivers of
       the IC but for the input current step waveform of the power stage. Designers familiar with a Cuk topology
       know that in this case both input and output currents are smooth. The Cuk converter is therefore often
       called the 'ideal DC to DC' converter, and expectedly its parasitic inductances can be largely ignored ----
       because there are no AC trace sections in the sense we described.
       Now if the input power to a Buck converter was coming through long leads from a distant voltage source,
       the inductance of the incoming leads would seriously inhibit their ability to provide the fast changing
       pulsed current shape. So an on-board source of power is required right next to the converter, and this is
       provided by the input capacitor. It provides the pulsed current, and then is itself refreshed at a slower rate
       (DC current) from the distant voltage source.
       However, since the input capacitor is fairly large in size, it may not be physically possible to place it as
       close as desired. Especially for very high speed switchers such as the LM267x series (note that a ‘high
       speed’ switcher as defined here, is one with a very small crossover/transition time, and it does not
       necessarily have to be one with a high switching frequency). In addition, the Equivalent Series
       Resistance (‘esr’) and Equivalent Series Inductance (‘esl’) of the main input capacitor may be too high,
       and this can cause high frequency input voltage ripple on the VIN pin.
       For the Buck converter schematic as shown in Figure 2, the input pin connects not only to the Drain of the
       FET switch, but also provides a low internally regulated supply rail to the control sections of the IC. But no
       real series pass regulator can 'hold off' very fast changes in the applied input voltage. Some noise will
       feed through into the control section and then much will depend on the internal sensitivity of the IC to
       noise (related to its design, internal layout, process/logic family). It is therefore best to try to keep voltage
       on the VIN pin fairly clean --—from a high frequency point of view. Note that it is not being suggested here
       that one responds to this statement by increasing the input capacitance indiscriminately, because we are
       not talking about the natural input voltage ripple which occurs at the rate of the switching frequency (for
       example, 100 kHz–260 kHz). Our concern here is the noise occurring at the moment of the transitions,
       and this noise spectrum peaks at around 10 MHz–30 MHz, as determined by the transition/crossover time
       of the switch. The crossover time has nothing to do with the basic PWM switching frequency, but does
       ofcourse depend on the type of switch used, that is, bipolar or FET.
       Therefore a high frequency ‘bypass’ or ‘decoupling’ capacitor with small or no leads, shown as
       ‘CBYPASS’ in Figure 2, is to be placed very close to the VIN and GND pins of the IC. This is usually a 0.1
       µF–0.47 µF (monolithic) multilayer ceramic (typically X7R type, size 1206 or the more recent 'inverted'
       termination version of this popular size, the '0612' ---- also note that smaller sized ceramic caps generally
       have higher esr/esl, but check before use). Since now this component provides the main pulsed current
       waveshape, the bulk capacitor shown as ‘CIN’, may be moved slightly further up (about an inch) without
       any deleterious effect. For lighter loads, and if it is possible to place the input bulk capacitor very close to
       the IC, the high frequency bypass capacitor may sometimes be omitted. But for high-speed switchers
       like the LM267x, the input ceramic bypass capacitor is considered almost mandatory for any
       application.
       The position of the catch diode is also critical. It too needs to be acap. Now, every topology has a node
       called the 'switching node'. This is the 'hot' or 'swinging' end of the switch. For integrated switchers, this
       node can also be an easy entry point for noise feed-through into the control sections. Note that the
       problem is not caused by the simple fact that the voltage at this node swings, for it is designed for exactly
       that situation in mind. The problem is with the additional noise spikes riding on top of the basic square
       voltage waveform, arising from the trace inductances as explained earlier. Therefore, it is essential to
       place the catch diode very close to the IC and connect it directly to the SW pin and GND pins of
       the IC, with traces that are very short and fairly wide . In some erroneous layouts, where the catch
       diode was not appropriately placed to start with, the converter could be ‘bandaided’ by a small series RC
       snubber. This consists typically of a resistor (low inductive type preferred) of value 10Ω–100Ω and a
       capacitor, which should be ceramic of value 470 pF–2.2 nF. Larger capacitance than this would lead
       to unacceptably higher dissipation (=1/2*C*V2*f), chiefly in the resistor, and would serve no additional
       purpose. However, note that this RC snubber needs to be placed very close to and across the
       Switching pin and Gnd pin of the IC, with short leads/traces. Sometimes designers think that this is
       'across the diode', because on the schematic there is no way to tell the difference. However, particularly

Routing the Traces                                                                                                         www.ti.com

       when the diode is a Schottky, the primary purpose of such a snubber is to absorb the voltage spikes of the
       trace inductances. Therefore its position must be such that it provides bypassing of the critical or AC trace
       sections of the output side as shown in Figure 2c (right hand side of the switcher) ----which means it must
       be close to the IC. Of course, as mentioned previously, it is best to get the layout right to start with, rather
       than adding such extra components.
       Remaining component placements can be taken up only after the input bypass capacitor and the catch
       diode are firmly in place and are both acap. The traces to either of these two components should be short,
       fairy wide, and should not go pass through any vias on the way to the IC. For SMT boards this implies that
       the input capacitor and catch diode are on the same layer as the IC. In Figure 1 suggested PCB starting
       points are provided for several switchers. All of them focus on placing these two critical components
       correctly. These layouts are strongly recommended for most applications. The 'X' marks suggest the
       recommended location where vias can be used to connect to a Ground Plane (if present).The
       remaining components can be placed relatively carelessly (though in doing so, there may be slight impact,
       for example on the accuracy of the output voltage rail and its ripple, but nothing compared to what can
       happen if the input decoupling cap and catch diode are incorrectly placed). Trace routing is now discussed
       in more detail.

5      Routing the Traces
       As mentioned above, it is not advisable to route any of the critical traces through ‘vias’. Vias are
       considered useful from a purely CAD perspective for ‘layer jumping’, but are often used indiscriminately as
       they seem an easy solution to connectivity problems. But they also add impedance, and that is exactly
       what we are trying to avoid. The inductance of a via is given by

                                                                                                                                    (1)
       where ‘h’ is the height of the via in mm (equal to the thickness of the board, commonly 1.6 mm), and ‘d’ is
       the diameter in mm. Therefore a single via of diameter 0.4 mm on a standard 1.6 mm board gives an
       inductance of 1.2 nH. It may not sound much, but it is almost twice that of a wire of the same length and
       diameter. It has been seen empirically that for the high speed LM267x series, if the bypass
       capacitor is connected through vias to the IC, occasional field problems do arise.So if vias have to
       be used for some reason, several vias in parallel will yield better results than a single via. And larger
       via diameters would help further (unless they are being used as 'thermal vias' --- discussed later).
       It is also said that “the traces also need to be ‘wide’ and ‘short’ ”. The necessity of short traces is clearly
       understood, usually intuitively, by most engineers. In fact, the thumb rule of ‘20 nH per inch’ also implies
       that trace inductance is almost proportional to length. However, a common ‘intuitive’ mistake is to
       assume that inductance is inversely proportional to the width of the trace. So some engineers
       mistakenly ‘add copper’ lavishly to critical traces (though there are some other reasons why this may be
       being done, and these will be discussed later). A first approximation for the inductance of a conductor
       having length ‘l’ and diameter ‘d’ is

                                                                                                                                    (2)
       where l and d are in centimeters. Note that the equation for a PCB trace is not much different from that of
       a wire.

                                                                                                                                    (3)
       where ‘w’ is the width of the trace. For PCB traces, L hardly depends on the thickness of the copper ( 1 oz
       or 2 oz board). Both Equation 2 and Equation 3 are plotted in Figure 3. It will be seen that for a given
       length, a PCB trace of width ‘x’ has higher inductance than a wire of diameter ‘x’. In fact, the width of a
       PCB trace has to be about 1.78 times the diameter of a wire for the same inductance.
       A wire of AWG 20 has a diameter of 32 mils (or 0.081 cm). So for a length of one inch (1000 mils or 2.54
       cm) L equals 21 nH (which is the usual thumb rule). We can see that L is almost proportional to length.
       But if we double the diameter to 0.16 cm, L equals 17 nH, which is not much different from 21 nH. This
       indicates a non-linear relationship. Referring to Figure 3, where the above function is plotted out (dotted
       lines are for a PCB trace), we can see that the diameter/width of a wire/trace has to typically increase
       by a factor of 10 for the inductance to halve. The relationship of L to d is therefore logarithmic in
       nature. The reason for this is the effects of mutual inductance between parallel sections/strips of the
       conductor.

                                       Figure 3. Inductance of Wire of Length ‘1’

       ‘Beefing up’ traces to reduce the effects of parasitic inductances should be a last resort. Decreasing the
       length of the trace should be the first step. Increasing the width of certain traces can in fact
       become counterproductive. In particular, the trace from the switch node to the diode is ‘hot’ from an EMI
       point of view. This is not only because of the AC (high frequency) current it carries, but because of its
       voltage, which is a switched waveform. Any conductor with a varying voltage, irrespective of the current,
       becomes an antenna if its dimensions are large enough. Radiated emissions from this antenna can cause
       undesirable common-mode interference in its vicinity. Therefore this calls for the area of the copper
       around the switching node to be reduced, not increased. Large planes of switched voltage also cause
       capacitive noise coupling into nearby traces. On a typical SMT board, if the opposite side happens to be a
       'ground plane', noise from the switching node can couple through the FR4 dielectric of the PCB into the
       Ground plane. No Ground plane is 'perfect', and therefore this injected high frequency noise can also
       cause the ground plane to not only radiate, but to pass noise onto the IC through 'ground bounce'. Some
       people suggest that a copper island, exactly the same size/shape as the switching-node island be created
       on the opposite side of the PCB, connected through several vias. This is supposed to prevent 'capacitive
       cross-talk' to other traces and to enhance thermal dissipation. But this obviously also leads to the
       breaking-up/partitioning of the Ground plane. This defeats the very purpose of Ground plane as it can
       cause strange effects arising due to the odd current flow patterns in the now divided Ground plane. In
       general, the Ground plane should be kept continuous/unbroken as far as possible, or it could
       behave like a slot antenna. For the switching node therefore, the best option is to keep the amount
       of copper around it to the actual minimum requirement.
       Some basic physics to be reminded of here: electric fields are caused by electric charge, and magnetic
       fields by currents. But if an electric field varies with time, it produces a corresponding magnetic field.
       However magnetic fields are associated with currents. Therefore AC voltages (varying electric fields) on
       opposite planes of copper on a PCB cause a 'displacement current' (capacitive coupling current) through
       the FR4 dielectric. Similarly, a varying magnetic field causes an electric field. So for example in a
       transformer, when we pass AC current (varying magnetic field) in a winding, we get Faraday induced
       voltages (electric field). Whenever voltage or current is switched, an electromagnetic field is generated,
       which produces EMI. And this EMI is inadvertently 'helped' by antenna structures. Therefore, on a PCB
       layout, the area enclosed by all current loops carrying 'AC (switched) current' must be kept small.
       Similarly the area of copper planes with 'AC (switched) voltage' must be kept small. Both can
       behave as antennae. In addition, traces carrying switching currents/voltages must also be kept
       away from 'quieter' traces to avoid cross-coupling. Further, since 'sharp edges' are known to
       cause an increase in field strengths, two 45 degree bends in a trace are preferred to a single 90
       degree bend.

6      Copper Filling: When to Stop
       Adding copper lavishly to traces serves some purpose occasionally, sometimes none at all, and
       sometimes it even works against the design in an unintended manner. There may be no simple hard and
       fast rules here. Judiciousness needs to be applied. But first it is instructive to consider some of the
       ‘reasons’ why copper is lavished, and to the degree it is really required. Most often the requirements are
       actually much less than predictions based on 'gut instinct':

       We will take each of these separately:

6.1    Current Handling Capability
       If we multiply the width of a trace with its thickness we get the ‘cross sectional area’ of the conductor. This
       determines the resistance (per unit length) of the conductor and the consequent self-heating. This leads to
       an estimable temperature rise. It is important to note that the ‘current handling capability’ is therefore not a
       ‘stake in the ground’ as some people think, but is related to a permissible temperature rise. Mil Standards
       call for maximum 20°C rise, but 30°C–40°C are also common. Figure 4 is a chart that helps in the correct
       estimation.

       Commercial PCB’s are often referred to as ‘1 oz’ or ‘2 oz’, for example. This refers to the weight of copper
       in ounces per square foot deposited on the copper clad laminate. 1 oz is actually equivalent to 1.4 mils
       copper thickness (or 35 µm). Similarly 2 oz is twice that. We are only considering outer layers (not
       internal layers) in this application report, and therefore at most double-sided (2 layer) boards.
       Using the thickness of the copper trace we can find the trace width required. For example for 1 oz copper
       board (1.4 mils copper thickness), and allowing 20°C rise in temperature, for 4A of current we need
       75/1.4=54 mils (1.4 mm) wide trace. For a 2 oz board we need exactly half of that, that is, 0.7 mm width.
       However note that a 1 oz double sided board will pass through an electroless copper plating process
       stage (before solder mask is applied) to create the vias (/PTH: Plated Through Hole), and so it may end
       up effectively as being considered closer to a 1.4 oz copper board. Therefore it is a good idea to check
       this out with the PCB manufacturer before even starting the layout. Also note that even a single-sided
       board passes through a hot air solder level finishing stage (after solder mask), where a thin Tin-Lead layer
       is deposited on the 'unmasked' (no solder mask) copper areas. This does increase the effective thickness
       of these traces, but doesn't help as much as copper plating, since Tin-Lead has 10 times higher resistivity
       than copper.
       When estimating resistive heating, it is important to know the average current in the traces. For a
       Buck converter, in the AC traces of the input sections (the left hand side of the IC in Figure 2c) the
       average current is lo × D, where lo is the load current and D the duty cycle. For the AC traces of the
       output section (the right-hand side), the average current is lo × (1-D). So if the load current is 3A, and the
       duty cycle (≈Vo/Vin) is say 0.4, then the average current on the input side is 1.2A only. On the output side
       it is 1.8A. In neither case is this equal to the load current of 3A! So the trace should be sized correctly and
       according to such a calculation.
       Note that the expected temperature rise stated above is based on ‘self-heating’. But a trace can become
       very hot simply due to heat from a nearby component. In that case, even a 30°C (additional) rise due to
       self-heating may be unacceptable. And the 'acceptable' rise also depends on worst-case ambient
       temperature, and also the rated temperature of the board laminate (keep below 120°C for FR4).
       A quick thumb rule that closely follows the above discussion, for moderate temperature rise (less than
       30°C) and currents less than 5A:

       •     Use at least 12 mils width of copper per amp for 1 oz board
       •     Use at least 7 mils width of copper per amp for 2 oz board

6.2    Trace Inductance
       We have seen that the preferred method to reduce trace inductance is to reduce length, not increase
       width. Beyond a certain point, widening of traces does not reduce inductance significantly. Nor does it
       depend much on whether we use 1 oz or 2 oz boards. Neither does it depend on whether the trace is
       unmasked or not (to allow solder/copper to deposit and thereby increase effective conductor thickness).
       But if for some reason the length cannot be reduced, another way to reduce inductance is by paralleling of
       forward and return current traces.
       Inductances exist because they can store magnetic energy. Therefore conversely, if the magnetic field is
       somehow cancelled, the inductance too vanishes. By paralleling two current traces, each carrying
       current of the same magnitude but in opposite direction on a PCB, the magnetic field is greatly reduced.
       These two traces should be parallel and very close. They can be run side-by-side on the same side for a
       single-sided board. If a double-sided PCB is being used, the most effective solution is to run the traces
       parallel and on opposite sides of the PCB. The traces can and should be fairly wide in this case to
       improve their mutual coupling and create the required field cancellation. Note that if a ground plane is
       used on one side, the return automatically ‘images’ the forward current trace and produces field
       cancellation and reduction in inductance.
       The designer may well ask: what happens to the inductance equation for trace length we presented
       earlier? ---that didn't seem to indicate that paralleling should help. The problem with the simple trace
       inductance equation is that it is an approximation. There is simply no such thing as an independent
       straight piece of wire carrying current in a given direction --- current must return and so there are
       only current loops. This follows from basic Physics --- charge cannot accumulate and must return: in this
       case to the opposite terminal of the emf source responsible for the flow of current. So whenever we talk
       about the inductance of just a single wire, basically we are talking about a very large loop. Since
       inductance of a current carrying loop is proportional to the area enclosed by the loop, if the loop area is
       made very small, inductance too is reduced.

6.3    Thermal Management
       Natural convection depends on the amount of surface area that is in contact with the air. If a conductive
       plate serving as a 'heatsink' is thick enough to ensure perfect thermal conduction into the far recesses of
       the plate, the temperature rise would have been simply inversely proportional to the total exposed area.
       PCB copper planes too are in that sense an aid to convection, the difference being that they are not thick
       enough to ensure perfect conduction. Therefore at some point, we will reach a point of diminishing returns:
       very large increases in the copper area will produce smaller and smaller improvement in the thermal
       resistance. This occurs roughly for a square of side 1 inch on a 1 oz copper board. Some improvement
       continues till about 3 inches, especially for 2 oz boards and better, but beyond that, external heatsinks are
       required. Ultimately, a reasonable practical value attainable for the thermal resistance (from the case of
       the power device to the ambient) is about 30°C/W.
       That is not to say that heat is lost only from the copper side. The usual laminate (board material) used for
       SMT applications is epoxy-glass ‘FR4’ (also known as GF or G10) which is a fairly good conductor of
       heat. More commercial and cost-effective applications use cheaper board materials like CEM1, CEM2,
       CEM3 and so on, which are fortunately not much worse as thermal conductors than FR4. So some of the
       heat from the device side does get to the other side where it contacts the air. Therefore putting a copper
       plane on the other side (this need not even be electrically the same node, it could be the ground
       plane) also helps, but only by about 10%–20% as compared to a copper plane on only one side. A
       much greater reduction of thermal resistance by about 50%–70% can be produced if ‘thermal vias’
       are used to conduct heat to the other side. This thermally ‘shunts’ or bypasses the board material to
       get the heat to the other side where there is more exposure to air movement.
       The tab of the power packages of the Simple Switcher devices is fortunately at Ground potential, so
       having large copper planes around the tab will not produce EMI. The tab can be left floating, but if it is
       used, it must be physically connected directly to the GND pin of the IC as indicated in Figure 1. If a
       double-sided board is used, several small vias can be sunk right next to the IC Ground in positions
       marked 'X' on to a ‘Ground plane’ on the other side of the PCB. These vias therefore not only help in the
       correct electrical implementation of grounding, but also can serve as thermal shunts. They are therefore

      appropriately called ‘thermal vias’. It is recommended that they be small (0.3 mm–0.33 mm barrel
      diameter) so that the hole is essentially filled up during the plating process, thus aiding
      conduction to the other side. Too large a hole can cause ‘solder wicking’ problems during the
      reflow soldering process. The pitch (distance between the centers) of several such thermal vias in
      an area is typically 1 mm–1.2 mm and a grid of thermal vias can be created right under the tab.
      Since the thermal vias also 'steal' heat away from the area during the reflow cycle, occasionally leading to
      poor solder joints, some recommend that vias (thermal or otherwise) should be close to, but never directly
      under the tab/legs/pins of any component.
      From the point of view of the internal construction of a typical switcher IC, there is no reason to make the
      trace around the switching node wide since very little heat can come out this way. As mentioned earlier,
      this node can act as an antenna and cause radiation problems. However, there are situations where a
      large amount of copper on the switching node may just be unavoidable. The tab of most power diodes is
      the cathode. To sink heat from the diode, a large heatsink or copper plane must be connected to the tab.
      Unfortunately for a conventional positive to positive Buck topology (unlike the positive to positive Boost or
      the negative to positive Buck-Boost) the cathode/tab of the diode corresponds to the switching node,
      which is not ‘quiet’. Therefore we have a conflict of interest here between thermal requirements and EMI.
      For EMI-sensitive applications, a rather non-typical diode with the anode internally connected to the tab
      can be sought. Or, if an external heatsink is being used, it is recommended that there be electrical (not
      thermal!) isolation between the power device and the (grounded) heatsink. Mica or 'Sil-pads' are possible
      choices here. If the diode must be SMT, an isolated SMT package may be a good choice.
      Overestimating the amount of the copper plane for device cooling is a common mistake, and can lead to
      excessive EMI. The heating in a Buck converter diode is based on the average current through the
      diode, not the load current. Note that a typical Schottky diode has a forward voltage drop of 0.5V. If the
      load current is 5A and the duty cycle is 0.4, the dissipation is only 5*0.5*(1–0.4)=1.5W. If the temperature
      of the board (the copper area around the tab) is to be say a maximum of 100°C, and the maximum
      ambient is 55°C, the allowed temperature rise here is 100–55=45°C. For 1.5W of estimated dissipation,
      the required board (or case) to ambient thermal resistance is 45/1.5=30°C/W. This as we have seen is
      achievable on a PCB. To calculate the required area, we can use as a good approximation an
      equation derived from empirical equations for a plate of area ‘A’:
           A = 985 × Rth−1.43 × P−0.28 sq.inches                                                                                      (4)

      Where: P is in Watts and Rth is the required thermal resistance in °C/W. Solving for our example:
      A = 985 × 30−1.43 × 1.5−0.28 sq.inches
      A = 6.79 sq.inches
      If this area is square in shape, the length of each side needs to be 6.790.5 = 2.6 inches. If the area called
      for exceeds 1 sq inch, a 2 oz board should be used. Clearly a 2 oz board should be used in the
      example, as it reduces the thermal ‘constriction’ around the power device and allows the large copper
      area to be more effectively used for convection. Note that we are considering only a copper plane
      exposed to air on one side of the PCB. Breaking up the Ground plane to create islands on the other side
      to connect to was not considered a good option as it leads to odd return current patterns.

7     Ground Plane
      With double-sided boards, it is a common practice to almost completely fill one side with ground. There
      are people who usually rightly so consider this a panacea or ‘silver bullet’ for most problems. As we have
      seen, every signal has a return, and as its harmonics get higher, the return ‘wants’ to be directly under the
      signal path, thus leading to field cancellation, and reduction of inductance. It also helps thermal
      management as it couples some of the heat produced by power devices on one side of the board to the
      other side. The Ground plane also capacitively links to noisy traces above it, causing some 'softening' of
      transients and thereby some reduction in noise/EMI ---unless the cross-coupling is so severe as to
      start causing the Ground plane itself to radiate. Vias can be sunk under the ground terminal of all
      power components in to the Ground plane, and this reduces DC resistance offset errors on the output
      voltage too for example. As mentioned, in Figure 1, ‘X’ marks have been placed to indicate that if there is
      a double sided board in use, and a Ground plane is present, then vias can be added at these points. They
      are optional, and so if a low cost single-sided board is preferred, they can be omitted. But if these vias are
      also doubling over as ‘thermal vias’ for the switcher IC, as when they are under the tab of an SMT power
      device, they should be sized appropriately as previously discussed.

       However, a Ground plane should be an ‘add-on’ to the recommendations in Figure 1. It does not
       substitute the correct placement of the two critical components. Much effort should go into not
       breaking or partitioning this plane. Further, in general, if too much switching power flow occurs through
       such a plane, it can create 'ground bounce' and cause controller upsets. Therefore in higher power
       applications, with the added luxury of multi-layer PCBs, separate signal and power ground planes are
       used. But for the lower power SIMPLE SWITCHER family, a single Ground plane is all that may be
       required. And if the layout is carried out conscientiously , keeping all the recommendations in mind, even a
       single-sided board should suffice.

8      Signal Traces: Feedback
       The only critical signal trace is the feedback trace. First consider only the Adjustable versions of the
       Simple Switchers. One end of the trace connects to a low impedance node, which is the output rail or a
       resistive divider at the output. The other end connects to the feedback pin, which is the high impedance
       input of the error amplifier. If this trace picks up noise (capacitively or inductively) as it passes between
       these two nodes, it can lead to erroneous output voltages, and in extreme cases even instability or device
       failure. There seem to be just two options for this
       1. Keep the feedback trace short if possible so as to minimize pickup AND/OR
       2. Keep it away from noise sources (for example, switching diode, inductor)
       Keeping the trace short may not be feasible. In fact, the feedback trace may be deliberately kept
       slightly longer so as to route it away from potential noise sources. It should not pass under the
       inductor or diode in particular. If a double-sided SMT board is being used, a good strategy is as
       follows:
       • use a via at the output resistive divider to bring the trace to the other side
       • run the trace to cut through the surrounding ground plane areas, taking care not to pass it under the
           inductor/diode and not parallel to any power trace on either side of the board (though it can cross them
           perpendicularly)
       • and then very close to the IC, use another via to bring out the trace to the component side where it
           connects to the feedback pin of the IC
       Refer to Figure 5a which shows the situation for the Adjustable part. The trace which picks up noise is
       bold. However, if we consider a fixed voltage part, we learn an important thing. This is Figure 5b. Note that
       the feedback trace here is not marked bold. The reason is that a trace can pick up noise only if at least
       one end of it is a high impedance node. In Figure 5b, the feedback pin goes to a resistive divider rather
       than directly to the input of the error amplifier. So it is relatively immune to noise pickup. The only section
       where noise can be picked up is inside the IC (shown bold), and this is a very short path. Applying the
       same principle to an Adjustable part provides another interesting way to route the feedback trace. One
       way is shown in Figure 5c. Here the length of the ‘feedback trace’ is very short, so it is relatively noise-
       free. The feedback resistors are physically close to the IC and the trace from the output to the upper
       resistor has low impedances on either side, and so does not pick up noise. However, the connection of
       the lower resistor to ground is not ideal as the resistive drop across the section marked ‘lo*R’ will affect
       the output voltage load regulation slightly. Another way is in Figure 5d, and this resolves both issues.
       This is therefore recommended. If a ground plane is used however, both Figure 5c and Figure 5d are
       actually the same if vias are correctly placed to couple into this plane. For Figure 5d, if possible, it is a
       good idea to run the top and bottom traces to the resistive divider parallel and close to each other, so as
       to minimize any further chance of noise pickup.

               How to Design a Simple Constant Current/Constant
                                        Voltage Buck Converter


                                                                   ABSTRACT
       Technical Information about designing a constant current, constant voltage (CC/CV) power converter is
       limited. The design implementation can be challenging from a complexity, efficiency, and cost perspective.
       The LM5117 device with its current monitor (CM) pin greatly simplifies the design process, allows current
       regulation without using a lossy current sense resistor, and saves cost in the process. This application
       note details the design approach using the LM5117 CM pin and the LMV431 for current regulation and
       voltage regulation, respectively.

1      Introduction
       A DC-to-DC converter is typically implemented as a constant voltage (CV) regulator. The control loop
       adjusts the duty cycle in order to maintain a constant output voltage regardless of changes to the input
       voltage and load current.
       A constant current (CC) converter regulates current the same way: the control loop adjusts the duty cycle
       to maintain a constant output current regardless of changes to the input voltage and output resistance. A
       change in output resistance causes the output voltage to adjust as the load resistance varies; the higher
       the output resistance, the greater the output voltage.
       A CC/CV converter regulates both current and voltage depending on the output resistance level.

2      Application Examples
       Many applications limit the maximum output resistance and resulting output voltage so that components
       connected to the output won’t be damaged, which is where constant voltage regulation engages. Some
       examples of CC/CV converter uses are applications driving a light-emitting diode (LED) or charging
       batteries or supercapacitors. The current is regulated for a range of output resistances; should the
       resistance increase beyond a certain level, the voltage is regulated, or “clamped.”
       Output-voltage accuracy may be crucial, particularly in battery applications and supercapacitor chargers.
       Precise voltage regulation enables more energy storage because you can set the voltage regulation point
       as close as possible to the maximum safe operating voltage rating of the storage device.

3      Traditional Methods of Implementing CC/CV
       Figure 1 outlines a typical discrete implementation of a CC/CV converter. The converter requires a sense
       resistor (RSENSE), an amplifier and a voltage regulation circuit (Vz). The current flowing through RSENSE sets
       the voltage across RFB, which is the feedback voltage of a controller. In this way, the current is regulated.
       As ROUT increases, the voltage on the output rises to a point where the Zener diode conducts, and the
       device transitions from a CC converter to a CV converter.

       As previously mentioned, the current through RSENSE sets the feedback voltage, which regulates the output
       current. Equation 1 expresses the relationship between the output current and VFB:

       Assuming a resistive load, Equation 2 governs the voltage at the output:
           VOUT    IOUT u ROUT                                                                                             (2)
       Equation 3 sets the voltage regulation level:
           VCLAMP VREF VZ                                                                                                  (3)
       As seen in Figure 1, a Zener diode regulates the voltage in CV mode. Using a Zener as a voltage clamp
       yields relatively poor voltage-accuracy performance because of the variation in Zener voltages from device
       to device. Two Zener diodes are sometimes used in series to prevent leakage current flowing from
       cathode to anode, which if present causes errors in the current regulation loop.

4      Drawbacks of the Traditional Method
       The traditional method requires the use of a sense resistor in series with the output in order to sense
       current. As a result, resistive losses will impact efficiency; Equation 4 shows the losses in the sense
       resistor
             RSENSEloss    IOUT 2 u RSENSE                                                                                 (4)
       Higher losses increase the operating temperature and reduce system efficiency because the resistor has
       all of the output current flowing through it. Cost also increases because low milliohm current-sense
       resistors are relatively expensive compared to a small signal resistor. The common-mode voltage range of
       the amplifier needs to be rated to the maximum output voltage. A high output voltage might increase the
       cost of the amplifier. To help save costs, you could use a floating bias supply to reduce the common-mode
       voltage range requirement, but that will increase the component count. The solution presented in Figure 1
       has many disadvantages, including added design complexity, board real estate required, cost and impact
       on system efficiency.

5      A Simple CC/CV Method Using the LM5117 Device
       The LM5117 is an emulated peak current-mode synchronous buck controller suitable for high-current,
       wide step-down conversions. The major benefit of using the LM5117 in a CC/CV application is that it has
       a current monitor (CM) feature. The CM pin provides an accurate voltage that is proportional to the output
       current of the buck power stage. The designer can use the CM pin as the current loop feedback, saving
       the additional current-sense circuitry that the traditional method requires. The voltage present on the CM
       pin is accurate to ±2%, provided that the converter is set to forced pulsed width modulation (FPWM) or is
       in continuous conduction mode. Figure 2 shows a basic CC/CV regulator implementation using the
       LM5117.

      Equation 5 describes the relationship between the CM voltage and IOUT:
          VCMAve      IPEAK + IVALLEY u RS u AS                                                                                    (5)
      Equation 6 simplifies Equation 5:
          VCMAve 2 u IOUT u RS u AS                                                                                                (6)
      As can be seen, the CM pin enables the designer to omit the series power dissipative current-sense
      resistor at the output. RS is the current-sense resistor of the power stage used to generate a ramp for the
      current-mode pulse-width modulation (PWM) loop. AS is the current-sense amplifier gain of the LM5117,
      which has a typical value of AS = 10.
      For example, assume that IOUT = 10 A and RS = 10 mΩ. Using Equation 7:
           VCMAve 2 u 10 A u 0.01: u 10
                                VCMAve     2V                                                                                      (7)
      Setting the resistor divider network from the CM pin to ground and connecting the divider node to the
      feedback pin sets the current regulation point. With 2 V at the CM pin, selecting the proper resistor-divider
      ratio sets the current regulation level. To set the resistor-divider values for 10-A current regulation, select
      RFBb = 10kΩ and calculate RFBt using Equation 8:
                           § VCMAve    ·
               RFBt        ¨        - 1¸ RFBb

      which yields an RFBt value of 15 kΩ.
      Remember to account for the reduction in AS caused by placing series filter resistors from RS and ground
      to CS and CSG, respectively. Refer to the LM5117 data sheet for more details on how resistors in series
      with the current-sense pins affect the gain of the internal current-sense amplifier.

7     CV Programming
      CV programing is achieved by using an LMV431 as a voltage clamp. Assume a voltage clamp level of 12
      V. The forward voltage drop Vfwd across BAT54 is 0.5 V, and the FB voltage of the LM5117 is 0.8 V. The
      voltage clamp engages when the voltage across R1 is equal to the voltage calculated using Equation 9:
           VR1    VFB + VFWD                                                                                (9)

       Therefore, VR1 = 1.3 V.
       The voltage at the reference pin of the LMV431 must be a reference voltage above VR1. The LMV431 has
       a reference voltage of 1.24 V, so the voltage at the reference pin of the LMV431 is equal to the voltage
       calculated using Equation 10:
             VREF   VR1 + VREF LMV431                                                                           (10)
       Therefore, a VREF = 2.54 V is required for the LMV431 to conduct current from its cathode to anode.

8      Power Design of the LM5117
       The design approach for the power section of a CC/CV converter using the LM5117 is the same as it is for
       a basic buck converter. TI suggests carrying out the design at the highest output power level (which is the
       highest output resistance) using either WEBENCH® Designer or the LM5117 Quick Start Calculator. Refer
       as well to the LM5117 data sheet for guidance on the design of the buck power stage.

1 Introduction
1.1 Scope
This application report can help system designers implement best practices and understand PCB layout options
when designing platforms. This document is intended for audiences familiar with PCB manufacturing, layout, and
design.
1.2 Critical Signals
A primary concern when designing a system is accommodating and isolating high-speed signals. As high-speed
signals are most likely to impact or be impacted by other signals, they must be laid out early (preferably first) in
the PCB design process to ensure that prescribed routing rules can be followed.
Table 1-1 outlines the high-speed interface signals requiring the most attention when laying out a PCB that
incorporates a Texas Instruments™ System-on-Chip (SoC).
                                                                      Table 1-1. Critical Signals

2 General High-Speed Signal Routing
2.1 PCB Fiber Weave Mitigation
When routing differential signals across common PCB materials, each trace of the pair will experience different
dielectric constants and corresponding signal velocities due to the differences in static permittivity (Ɛr) of the
fiberglass weave (Ɛr is approximately 6) and epoxy (Ɛr is approximately 3) that comprise a PCB. As signals
travel faster when Ɛr is lower, an interpair skew can develop if a signal in a differential pair travels over a
higher ratio of fiberglass or epoxy than does its companion signal. This skew between the differential signals can
significantly degrade the differential eye diagram as presented to the receiver, cause significant AC common-
mode voltage noise, and cause EMI issues. The extent of this problem will depend on the bus speed, the length
of the traces, the trace geometries, the type of fiberglass weave used, and the alignment of the traces to the
weave pattern of a PCB. Problems from fiber weave alignment vary from board to board. This variance makes
issues difficult to diagnose.
Figure 2-1, Figure 2-2, and Figure 2-3 show the three most common methods to minimize the impact of PCB
fiber weave in a board design. The goal of each method is to ensure that both signals of the differential pair will
share a relatively common Ɛr across the length of the pair routing.

     The entirety of the signaling image plane is rotated 10° to 35° in relation to the underlying PCB fiber weave.
     The PCB manufacturer can effect this rotation without making changes to the PCB layout database.

     The high-speed differential signals are routed in a zig-zag fashion across the PCB.

                                                    Figure 2-3. Zig-Zag Routing

Because the ratio of fiberglass to epoxy is the primary contributor to the Ɛr disparity, choose a PCB style with a
tighter weave, less epoxy, and greater Ɛr uniformity across longer trace lengths. Before sending your design out
for fabrication, specify a PCB style that can best accommodate high-speed signals. For examples of common
PCB styles, see Figure 2-4.

2.2 High-Speed Signal Trace Lengths
As with all high-speed signals, keep total trace length for signal pairs to a minimum. For trace length
requirements for each device, see Appendix A.

2.3 High-Speed Signal Trace Length Matching
Match the etch lengths of the relevant differential pair traces of each interface. The etch length of the differential
pair groups do not need to match (that is, the length of the transmit pair does not need to match the length of the
receive pair). When matching the intrapair length of the high-speed signals, add serpentine routing to match the
lengths as close to the mismatched ends as possible. For more details, see Figure 2-5.




                                                                                       Length-Matching at Matched Ends

2.4 High-Speed Signal Reference Planes
High-speed signals should be routed over a solid GND reference plane and not across a plane split or a void in
the reference plane unless absolutely necessary. TI does not recommend high-speed signal references to power
planes.
Routing across a plane split or a void in the reference plane forces return high-frequency current to flow around
the split or void. This can result in the following conditions:
•   Excess radiated emissions from an unbalanced current flow
•   Delays in signal propagation delays due to increased series inductance
•   Interference with adjacent signals
•   Degraded signal integrity (that is, more jitter and reduced signal amplitude)
For examples of correct and incorrect plane void routing, see Figure 2-6 and Figure 2-7.

If routing over a plane-split is completely unavoidable, place stitching capacitors across the split to provide a
return path for the high-frequency current. These stitching capacitors minimize the current loop area and any
impedance discontinuity created by crossing the split. These capacitors should be 1 µF or lower and placed as
close as possible to the plane crossing. For examples of incorrect plane-split routing and correct stitch capacitor
placement, see Figure 2-8 and Figure 2-9.

When planning a PCB stackup, ensure that planes that do not reference each other are not overlapped because
this produces unwanted capacitance between the overlapping areas. To see an example of how this capacitance
could pass RF emissions from one plane to the other, see Figure 2-10.

The entirety of any high-speed signal trace should maintain the same GND reference from origination to
termination. If unable to maintain the same GND reference, via-stitch both GND planes together to ensure
continuous grounding and uniform impedance. Place these stitching vias symmetrically within 200 mils (center-
to-center, closer is better) of the signal transition vias. For an example of stitching vias, see Figure 2-11.

3 High-Speed Differential Signal Routing
3.1 Differential Signal Spacing
To minimize crosstalk in high-speed interface implementations, the spacing between the signal pairs must be
a minimum of 5 times the width of the trace. This spacing is referred to as the 5W rule. A PCB design with a
calculated trace width of 6 mils requires a minimum of 30 mils spacing between high-speed differential pairs.
Also, maintain a minimum keep-out area of 30 mils to any other signal throughout the length of the trace. Where
the high-speed differential pairs abut a clock or a periodic signal, increase this keep-out to a minimum of 50 mils
to ensure proper isolation. For examples of high-speed differential signal spacing, see Figure 3-1 and Figure 3-2.

3.2 High-Speed Differential Signal Rules
•   Do not place probe or test points on any high-speed differential signal.
•   Do not route high-speed traces under or near crystals, oscillators, clock signal generators, switching power
    regulators, mounting holes, magnetic devices, or ICs that use or duplicate clock signals.
•   After BGA breakout, keep high-speed differential signals clear of the SoC because high current transients
    produced during internal state transitions can be difficult to filter out.
•   When possible, route high-speed differential pair signals on the top or bottom layer of the PCB with an
    adjacent GND layer. TI does not recommend stripline routing of the high-speed differential signals.
•   Ensure that high-speed differential signals are routed ≥ 90 mils from the edge of the reference plane.
•   Ensure that high-speed differential signals are routed at least 1.5 W (calculated trace-width × 1.5) away from
    voids in the reference plane. This rule does not apply where SMD pads on high-speed differential signals are
    voided.
•   Maintain constant trace width after the SoC BGA escape to avoid impedance mismatches in the transmission

3.3 Symmetry in the Differential Pairs
Route all high-speed differential pairs together symmetrically and parallel to each other. Deviating from this
requirement occurs naturally during package escape and when routing to connector pins. These deviations must
be as short as possible and package break-out must occur within 0.25 inches of the package.




                                               Figure 3-3. Differential Pair Symmetry

3.4 Crosstalk Between the Differential Signal Pairs
In devices that include multiple high-speed interfaces, avoiding crosstalk between these interfaces is important.
To avoid crosstalk, ensure that each differential pair is not routed within 30 mils of another differential pair after
package escape and before connector termination.
3.5 Connectors and Receptacles
When implementing a through-hole receptacle (like a USB Standard-A), TI recommends making high-speed
differential signal connections to the receptacle on the bottom layer of the PCB. Making these connections on
the bottom layer of the PCB prevents the through-hole pin from acting as a stub in the transmission path. For
surface-mount receptacles such as USB Micro-B and Micro-AB, make high-speed differential signal connections
on the top layer. Making these connections on the top layer eliminates the need for vias in the transmission path.
For examples of USB through-hole receptacle connections, see Figure 3-4.

3.6 Via Discontinuity Mitigation
A via presents a short section of change in geometry to a trace and can appear as a capacitive and/or an
inductive discontinuity. These discontinuities result in reflections and some degradation of a signal as it travels
through the via. Reduce the overall via stub length to minimize the negative impacts of vias (and associated via
stubs).
Because longer via stubs resonate at lower frequencies and increase insertion loss, keep these stubs as
short as possible. In most cases, the stub portion of the via present significantly more signal degradation than
the signal portion of the via. TI recommends keeping via stubs to less than 15 mils. Longer stubs must be
back-drilled.
For examples of short and long via lengths, see Figure 3-5 and Figure 3-6.

3.7 Back-Drill Stubs
Back-drilling is a PCB manufacturing process in which the undesired conductive plating in the stub section of a
via is removed. To back-drill, use a drill bit slightly larger in diameter than the drill bit used to create the original
via hole. When via transitions result in stubs longer than 15 mils, back-drill the resulting stubs to reduce insertion
losses and to ensure that they do not resonate.

3.8 Increase Via Anti-Pad Diameter
Increasing the via anti-pad diameter reduces the capacitive effects of the via and the overall insertion loss.
Ensure that anti-pad diameter for vias on any high-speed signal are as large as possible (30 mils provides
significant benefits without imposing undue implementation hardship). The copper clearance, indicated by this
anti-pad, must be met on all layers where the via exists, including both routing layer and plane layers. The traces
connecting to the via barrel contain the only copper allowed in this area; non-functional or unconnected via pads
are not permitted. For an example of a via anti-pad diameter, see Figure 3-7.




                                                                           Via Pad      Anti-Pad

3.9 Equalize Via Count
If using vias is necessary on a high-speed differential signal trace, ensure that the via count on each member of
the differential pair is equal and that the vias are as equally spaced as possible. TI recommends placing vias as
close as possible to the SoC.
3.10 Surface-Mount Device Pad Discontinuity Mitigation
Avoid including surface-mount devices (SMDs) on high-speed signal traces because these devices introduce
discontinuities that can negatively affect signal quality. When SMDs are required on the signal traces (for
example, the USB SuperSpeed transmit AC coupling capacitors) the maximum permitted component size is
0603. TI strongly recommends using 0402 or smaller. Place these components symmetrically during the layout
process to ensure optimum signal quality and to minimize reflection. For examples of correct and incorrect AC
coupling capacitor placement, see Figure 3-8.

To minimize the discontinuities associated with the placement of these components on the differential signal
traces, TI recommends voiding the SMD mounting pads of the reference plane by 100%. This void should be at
least two PCB layers deep. For an example of a reference plane voiding of surface mount devices, see Figure
3-9.

3.11 Signal Bending
Avoid the introduction of bends into high-speed differential signals. When bending is required, maintain a bend
angle greater than 135° to ensure that the bend is as loose as a possible. For an example of high-speed signal
bending rules, see Figure 3-10.

(1)   Route directly adjacent signal layers at a 90° offset to each other
(2)   Plane may be split depending on specific board considerations. Ensure that traces on adjacent planes do not cross splits.

3.13 ESD/EMI Considerations
When choosing ESD/EMI components, TI recommends selecting devices that permit flow-through routing of the
USB differential signal pair because they provide the cleanest routing. For example, the TI TPD4EUSB30 can be
combined with the TI TPD2EUSB30 to provide flow-through ESD protection for both USB2 and USB3 differential
signals without the need for bends in the signal pairs. For an example of flow-through routing, see Figure 3-11.

3.14 ESD/EMI Layout Rules
•   Place ESD and EMI protection devices as close as possible to the connector.
•   Keep any unprotected traces away from protected traces to minimize EMI coupling.
•   Incorporate 60% voids under the ESD/EMI component signal pads to reduce losses.
•   Use 0402 0-Ω resistors for common-mode filter (CMF) no-stuff options because larger components will
    typically introduce more loss that the CMF itself.
•   Place any required signal pair AC coupling capacitors on the protected side of the CMF and as close as
    possible to the CMF.
•   If vias are needed to transition to the CMF layer, ensure that the vias are as close as possible to the CMF.
•   Keep the overall routing of AC coupling capacitors + CMF + ESD protection as short and as close as possible
    to the connector.

1. Defined in MIPI D-PHY spec; includes sdc12, scd21, scd12, sdc21, scd11, sdc11, scd22, and sdc22.
   General estimate is UI/50 (where UI = 400 ps for 1.25 GHz).
2. Because the MIPI signals are used for low-power, single-ended signaling in addition to their high-speed
   differential implementation, the pairs must be loosely coupled.
3. Defined by MIPI spec as 0.1 x UI (where UI = 400 ps for 1.25 GHz).

 Differential pair to any other signal trace spacing                                              30                                      Mils


1. Defined in MIPI D-PHY spec; includes sdc12, scd21, scd12, sdc21, scd11, sdc11, scd22, and sdc22.
   General estimate is UI/50 (where UI = 400 ps for 1.25 GHz).
2. Because the MIPI signals are used for low-power, single-ended signaling in addition to their high-speed
   differential implementation, the pairs must be loosely coupled.
3. Defined by MIPI spec as 0.1 x UI (where UI = 400 ps for 1.25 GHz).
